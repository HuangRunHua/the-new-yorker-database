Dr. Kristin Moffitt, an infectious disease physician at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, suggests getting your shot now, rather than trying to time it for right before holiday events. After getting vaccinated, it takes a week or two for your immune response to develop. That protection should stay strong for at least two months, so \u201cif people got boosted now, their maximum immunity from that booster would get them through the end of 2022,\u201d Moffitt says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before thinking about boosters, of course, you should make sure everyone in your family has had their primary vaccinations, says Dr. Lilly Immergluck, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Morehouse School of Medicine. That\u2019s especially important advice for families with kids, given the dismally low vaccination rates among young children."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Rapid test before you gather"}, {"role": "body", "text": "When new variants emerge, there\u2019s often concern that at-home tests won\u2019t be able to detect them. But Dr. Roy Gulick, chief of infectious disease at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, says rapid tests should still pick up BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 infections, since those variants are Omicron relatives."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Frequent testing can help prevent those in your circle from unknowingly spreading the virus at holiday events. When Immergluck\u2019s relatives stayed together over the Fourth of July weekend, she asked everyone to take a rapid test every day. \u201cThat\u2019s not a 100% [guarantee],\u201d she says, \u201cbut it\u2019s about as good as we could get.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If you test negative but have classic COVID-19 symptoms such as sore throat, chills, and body aches, it\u2019s still best to stay home, Gulick adds."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Stay safe during travel"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Masks aren\u2019t required for most travel anymore, but Gulick still advises wearing one\u2014at least during certain portions of your trip. In general, air quality on planes is better than on buses and trains, so your chances of getting sick in the air are fairly low. But Gulick recommends masking while in the airport and when your plane is taxiing, since filtration systems may not be turned on when the plane is grounded. And if you\u2019re traveling by bus or train, it\u2019s a good idea to mask during the entire journey."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Keep an eye on the data"}, {"role": "body", "text": "COVID-19 case counts are not as accurate as they once were, in large part because so many people now test themselves at home instead of using laboratories where results are then reported to public-health authorities. But there are still some metrics you can watch to get a sense of viral prevalence in your area. Hospitalization and death rates are still solid indicators of how widely the virus is spreading, Immergluck says. Moffitt also recommends paying attention to test positivity rates. Even if fewer people get tested in laboratories, knowing the percentage of tests that come back positive is \u201ca fairly reliable marker because it\u2019s relative to the number of tests that are being performed,\u201d she says."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Consider who you\u2019re seeing"}, {"role": "body", "text": "If you\u2019ll be spending time with loved ones who are immunocompromised, unvaccinated, or elderly, you may want to increase your precautions, perhaps by masking indoors or keeping festivities outside. \u201cWe need to protect [vulnerable] people by not giving them the virus,\u201d Gulick says."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Don\u2019t forget about other viruses"}, {"role": "body", "text": "COVID-19 has dominated our thinking for the last few years, but influenza and RSV are also sickening lots of people right now. Moffitt says that\u2019s all the more reason to take precautions like masking during travel and avoiding high-risk settings, such as crowded indoor events, in the week or so before your holiday plans. Getting a flu shot is also an important winter health measure, Gulick says, and one that can be done when you\u2019re getting your COVID-19 booster."}, {"role": "body", "text": "   "}]}
