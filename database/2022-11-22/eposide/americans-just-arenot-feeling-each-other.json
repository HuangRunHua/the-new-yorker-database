After all, a TIME/Harris survey conducted in the weeks before the midterm elections found that only about a quarter of Americans (27%) said their feelings about the state of the nation are \u201cpositive.\u201d And yet."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Asked in the same poll about their own feelings, Americans were measurably less downbeat. For every topic we asked about, more people judged it to be bumming out the country than said it was bothering them personally. While 63% say the economy is negatively affecting the mood of the country, for instance, only 57% called it a drag on their own outlook. Fifty percent of people said rights issues, including race relations, were adversely affecting the nation\u2019s mood, but only 39% said they affected their own. A similar gap showed up when the survey offered a list of emotions, asking people to choose the one they had felt most over the previous 30 days\u2014and later, to choose the one that described the mood of Americans overall."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cGiven the near-constant stream of doom and gloom Americans absorb from the news, it is unsurprising that they characterize the nation\u2019s mood as frustrated (23%), anxious (12%), and disappointed (11%),\u201d notes Will Johnson, CEO of the Harris Poll. \u201cThe good news, however, is that the leading adjectives they use to describe their own mood are hopeful (15%) and happy (14%). Only 14% report that they themselves are frustrated.\u201d"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "\u2018People rate the national mood as worse than their own\u2019"}, {"role": "body", "text": "WHAT\u2019S GOING ON? There\u2019s reason to believe that, when asked to describe the state of the nation, people naturally describe the one they see on TV or read about on their phones\u2014a place defined by strife, confrontation, and extremes. And that\u2019s before being amplified by social media. In other words, America\u2019s citizens may not be nearly as distressed as America\u2019s political discourse is\u2014a discourse that, of course, includes polls that tell us how distressed we are."}, {"role": "body", "text": "To dig deeper, a Boston-area think tank called Populace has endeavored to measure \u201cprivate opinion,\u201d or views that a person holds but might not share with a pollster. Told of the persistent mood-perception gap in the TIME/Harris survey, Populace founder Todd Rose said, \u201cI would predict the gap is actually substantially larger.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The heart of the issue, Rose theorizes, is that people likely sense that certain responses are \u201cexpected\u201d based on how they\u2019ve identified themselves. \u201cMost people want to be with their group, not against their group,\u201d he says. \u201cSo whenever you\u2019re reading the mood of the group, people will kind of go toward what they\u2019re supposed to feel or say.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "To get beyond those expectations, Populace will slide a \u201csensitive\u201d statement in with four other statements that are both less delicate and also previously polled, then ask the subject to select three statements they agree with. After sorting the results, Populace was able to learn this past spring that, while 43% of people had told a pollster that \u201cpublic schools focus too much on racism,\u201d only 33% said that when asked less directly. Similar gaps showed up on abortion, and the effectiveness of masks against spreading COVID-19."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In other research, Populace has found Americans largely agree on which issues are most important to them\u2014but assume (incorrectly) that other people feel different. The persistence of that perception, Rose notes, \u201cis the same as being truly divided.\u201d But if we\u2019re actually not, that\u2019s more than a ray of hope. It\u2019s a shaft of sunlight."}]}
