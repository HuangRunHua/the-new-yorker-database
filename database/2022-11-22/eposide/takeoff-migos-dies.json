He was 28. The rapper, whose real name was Kirshnik Khari Ball, was known for his gruff and effortlessly agile delivery and long-reaching influence on trap music, a regional subgenre that would come to define modern American pop music."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Migos, made up of Takeoff, his uncle Quavo, and cousin Offset, made their swift and towering ascent to the top of the music industry in the early 2010s. While at the time, Quavo and Offset grabbed more attention\u2014for which star they dated or which party they graced\u2014Takeoff quickly emerged as the group\u2019s the best rapper."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Young and Hungry"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The three Migos grew up together in Gwinnett County, in suburban Atlanta. In his 2018 song \u201cI Remember,\u201d Takeoff recalled bleak days in which he sold drugs as he watched his friends and family get locked up: \u201cMy n****s done had cases after cases / Go to places, come back, break the suitcase down in mama\u2019s basement.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In their spare time, the three family members started making music together, and pioneered a new version of trap music\u2014a Southern, slow, and menacing form of hip-hop\u2014reliant on nihilistically bare beats, rapid-fire triplet flows, and rousing, absurdist ad-libs. As the trio made a name for themselves locally\u2014by turning up strip clubs and basement parties\u2014they also gained a rabid following online, as regional rap extended its tendrils across blogs, forums, and early social media."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2013, Drake remixed the group\u2019s hit \u201cVersace,\u201d sending them to another level of notoriety. While the group battled legal issues and jail time, it was their work ethic that kept them from being a one-hit wonder: \u201cIt\u2019s a day job and a night job,\u201d Takeoff told the Fader in 2013, in between studio sessions and live appearances."}, {"role": "head", "text": "Fame"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over the next few years, Migos\u2019 rise would occur largely without the help of traditional gatekeepers. The New York Times reported in early 2017 that their number one hit, \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d was ignored for months by radio and late-night music bookers. Migos didn\u2019t sound like what was on the radio at the time: it was comparatively unpolished, rowdy and sounded vaguely threatening to unfamiliar ears."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Those snubs had little to no impact on the Migos, who decided to debut \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d on Soundcloud, which represented the forefront of rap culture at the time. In memes and blogs, many quickly proclaimed that the Migos were \u201cbetter than the Beatles.\u201d The group popularized the dance move the dab\u2014which rapidly turned from trendy to cringey as white teens got a hold of it on Vine\u2014and Donald Glover anointed \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d \u201cthe best song \u2026 ever\u201d onstage at the Golden Globes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Through this rise, Takeoff remained a tertiary public presence next to Quavo, the slick-talking, jewelry-laden quasi-frontman, and Offset, who made up one of rap\u2019s foremost power couples alongside Cardi B. Takeoff was often relegated the last verse of songs, patiently waiting for his bandmates to finish. And he didn\u2019t even have a verse on \u201cBad and Boujee\u201d\u2014a fact that was memed endlessly after a question about his omission sparked a confrontation between Migos and Joe Budden at the 2017 BET Awards."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But in Migos\u2019 music overall, Takeoff played a central role in his poise and ferocity, and only improved his craft over the years. It wasn\u2019t the actual words he delivered that made him stand out, but the way he delivered them: emphatically accenting unexpected syllables; stuffing dozens of words into bars with both fleet and force. \u201cF-ckin\u2019 with the wrong one, trippin\u2019 / Thirty round extension for the tension / Hundred round drum, listen / F-ck around and end up missin\u2019,\u201d he rapped on \u201cGet Right Witcha.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "He hit another high point on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cDrip,\u201d effortlessly mixing menace and humor and deploying rhythmic jukes to constantly surprise the listener: \u201cAbort the mission, n****, they be tellin\u2019 off and squealin\u2019 / Splash, took a bitch to Piccadilly / Water in my ear, gave a n**** wet willy.\u201d"}, {"role": "head", "text": "Influence"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Before long, the triplet-based \u201cMigos Flow\u201d that Takeoff had in particular perfected would become ubiquitous on the rap and pop charts, thanks to more sanitized artists like Post Malone and Ariana Grande. Once mostly meme fodder, trap would soon become a respected, endlessly-dissected culture and art form. \u201cTrap is the only music that sounds like what living in contemporary America feels like,\u201d Jesse McCarthy wrote in N+1 Magazine in 2018. \u201cIt is the soundtrack of the dissocialized subject that neoliberalism made.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThe fact that [rap] now the new normal is a triumph for voices who haven\u2019t always had platforms to call their own\u2013and finally do,\u201d Raisa Bruner wrote in TIME in 2018. \u201cMigos are smart to call their albums \u2018culture.\u2019 That\u2019s exactly what it sounds like.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Takeoff received praise for his 2018 solo record The Last Rocket, as well as his duo album Only Built for Infinity Links with Quavo, which was released this October.
