But these games also offer a sobering preview of another future, one in which the kinds of record-breaking heat waves that roasted Asia, Europe, and North America this summer are no longer extreme events but seasonal norms brought about by a changing climate.

Qatar\u2019s 2 million-strong foreign workforce, which makes up more than two-thirds of the population, is largely recruited from Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.

Scientists use an index called the wet-bulb globe temperature, or WBGT, to assess the impact of heat and humidity. Developed by the U.S. Marines in the 1950s, it combines temperature, humidity, and solar-radiation measurements into a single number expressed as a temperature. A WBGT above 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C) is considered to be the \u201cthreshold of survivability.\u201d A reading of 90.5\u00b0F (32.5\u00b0C) is considered the redline for heat injury for any kind of activity.

Many of the deaths occurred during periods when the WBGT exceeded 87\u00b0F (31\u00b0C), leading the authors to conclude that at least 200 men likely died from heat injuries sustained by working, even though the cause was listed as cardiac arrest. Qatar\u2019s labor law requires employers to pay compensation only if a death is work related, which is usually, narrowly interpreted as taking place at the work site. A heart attack that occurs in worker accommodations at the end of a strenuous day, as happened with Indrajit\u2019s uncle, doesn\u2019t qualify.
