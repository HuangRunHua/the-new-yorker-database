Civilization was an afterthought, except within the Indigenous communities that would fall prey to the genocidal ideology of Manifest Destiny. The conflict between ruthless, lawless self-interest and the human instinct to form bonds of mutual care has always been central to the western genre. Yet it\u2019s rare to see a variation on the theme achieve the depth and poignance of The English."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Written and directed by Hugo Blick, the creator of sophisticated, politically engaged British dramas like The Honorable Woman, this insightful Amazon-BBC co-production, which comes to Prime Video on Nov. 11, opens with a chance encounter. Upon arriving at a dusty hotel in the desolate Kansas of 1890, Lady Cornelia Locke (Emily Blunt) finds a badly beaten man, Eli Whipp (Chaske Spencer), chained to a post. She\u2019s an English aristocrat on a mission to kill the man who killed her son. He\u2019s a newly retired Pawnee scout traveling to Nebraska to claim land he\u2019s owed under the Homestead Act but\u2014despite and because his ancestors made their homes in the same area\u2014will likely have to take by force. She saves him, then he saves her. They\u2019re strangers, but unlike other strangers who cross paths on these eerily empty plains, they\u2019ve earned each other\u2019s trust."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As they ride north, it slowly becomes apparent that they have more in common than a direction or their loneliness or an increasingly affectionate allyship. Known for the complexity of both his story lines and the moral quagmires he creates, Blick populates three decades\u2019 worth of history surrounding the dual protagonists with often-ghoulish supporting characters who represent all sorts of wild, self-serving beliefs about destiny, loyalty, revenge, ethics, identity. The English makes the argument that these mismatched convictions, forged from the bloody battles fought between Native Americans and European invaders but also within each broadly defined group, converged to form a fantasy known as the United States of America."}, {"role": "body", "text": "TV\u2019s greatest western, Deadwood, arrived at a similar conclusion, paraphrasing an adage attributed to Napoleon as \u201chistory is a lie agreed upon.\u201d The story of Cornelia and Eli is a different kind of lie; it\u2019s a fiction, and one whose sentimentality in later installments of the six-episode series barely undermines its beauty as a counter-narrative. Violent, macabre, and in many ways tragic, The English doesn\u2019t deny what we know about what really happened when cultures collided on the frontier. Instead, it finds beauty in imagining how different people in the same situation, driven by purer motives and united by trust, might have built something better."}]}
