And then there\u2019s Lula himself: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard a president of Brazil speak like he did about the Amazon in a victory speech.

Roughly 90% of deforestation that takes place in the country is illegal under the nation\u2019s forest code and other environmental laws. But enforcement struggles have allowed a massive 34% of the Brazilian Amazon to be cleared since 1985\u2014much more than any other country\u2019s share. Cattle ranching has become the main driver of deforestation in Brazil as global demand for beef has increased over the last few decades. But soy farmers, small-scale miners, and loggers also play a role.

After that, Lula\u2019s environment minister Marina Silva\u2014who some expect to return to the role in Lula\u2019s new government\u2014instituted a three point plan to cut deforestation. It focused on: a) improving the management of public lands and land records, b) cracking down on law breakers with fines and expanding state presence in the rainforest, and c) incentivizing sustainable agriculture and logging practices in the Amazon. In 2012, just 1,600 square miles were lost\u2014the lowest level on record."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That success came undone later. In 2012, during Roussef\u2019s government, congress passed a controversial reform to the forest code that offered amnesty for some deforestation and relaxed requirements for forest conservation on private lands. Deforestation has been on an upward trajectory ever since. It accelerated after 2019 under Bolsonaro and his environment minister Ricardo Salles.
