Charge the people\u2014$7.99 a month for a coveted blue check mark. Musk, who completed his $44 billion purchase of the social media platform in late October, has been critical of Twitter\u2019s verification system, in which high-profile users\u2014journalists, government officials, brands, and other public figures\u2014can apply for \u201cverified\u201d status that confirms their identity, and gives them prestige and prominence on the platform by placing a blue check mark next to their username. This designation, he argued in a tweet, creates a \u201clords & peasants system.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Musk also needs Twitter to make money, fast. The company is now loaded with $13 billion in debt and has not turned a profit for eight of the past 10 years. Last week, Musk began cost-saving efforts by laying off about half of Twitter\u2019s workforce, or some 3,700 jobs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So this new pay-to-verify plan called Twitter Blue is Musk\u2019s first effort to open up new revenue streams. Like many other social media companies, Twitter has long been reliant on advertising, which is responsible for 90% of the company\u2019s revenue. But this approach has proved disastrous for stock prices lately as ad spending stalls. And Musk is also facing a growing advertiser revolt from brands nervous about what he\u2019s doing with the company. Under the new Twitter Blue system, Twitter users who want to keep using the site for free can do so\u2014but their posts will be ranked lower and they will see twice as many ads, Musk tweeted."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "\u2018They should pay me. If that gets instituted, I\u2019m gone like Enron.\u2019AUTHOR STEPHEN KING, ON MUSK\u2019S TWITTER SUBSCRIPTION PLAN"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The initial backlash to the proposal was fierce. \u201cThey should pay me. If that gets instituted, I\u2019m gone like Enron,\u201d the novelist Stephen King, who has 6.9 million followers, tweeted. In a Twitter poll posted by Musk ally Jason Calacanis, 81% of respondents wouldn\u2019t pay for a blue check. Critics of the idea have voiced a slew of concerns. One is that trolls and other bad actors could buy a larger presence on the platform. When Twitter has expanded verification in years past, it has hit major snags: in 2017, the company granted a blue check to Jason Kessler months after he spearheaded the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., giving him a much larger megaphone. (It was removed a week later after an uproar.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Expanded verification could also help scammers flourish on the site. Public figures on Twitter are already besieged by impostors seeking to trick victims with crypto scams. Under a less-stringent system, one imagines, it would be easy for scammers to buy up blue-checked accounts and loop in victims before getting shut down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It\u2019s unclear exactly what measures Twitter will proactively take to confirm that people are who they claim to be. On Nov. 6, Musk tweeted that any account that impersonates someone else will be permanently suspended without warning\u2014after comedian Kathy Griffin was suspended for changing her account name to \u201cElon Musk.\u201d A few days later Twitter introduced an \u201cofficial\u201d label for verified high-profile accounts, but Musk seemed to contradict that, tweeting, \u201cBlue check will be the great leveler.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there\u2019s the constant threat of misinformation. Musk may have foreshadowed a surge of fake news on the site just three days after taking ownership when he tweeted out a far-right conspiracy theory about the attack on Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband. (Musk also tweeted out a plea for Americans to vote Republican in the midterms.) Critics worry that Musk\u2019s new verification system would place debunked claims on the same plane as tweets from authoritative sources."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But while many users bristle at the idea of paying for social media, one of the most prominent critics of Big Tech\u2014the technologist Jaron Lanier\u2014has long argued that subscription-based social media could actually solve many of its major problems. At the moment, social media companies use your data to sell ads: a \u201cstyle of business plan that spews out perverse incentives and corrupts people,\u201d he wrote in the Guardian in 2018."}, {"role": "body", "text": "MUSK NEEDS PEOPLE to start subscribing immediately. On Nov. 4, he defended the company layoffs\u2014which were criticized for their speed and chaotic rollout\u2014as being unavoidable for a company losing $4 million a day. But even if all of the estimated 400,000 of Twitter\u2019s verified accounts agreed to pay the $7.99 a month, that would net Twitter only $38 million\u2014a drop in the bucket compared with existing annual revenue of $5 billion. Musk is reportedly considering a slew of other monetization strategies, including \u201cpaywalled\u201d videos and paid direct messages to high-profile users."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As fears of increased hate speech and misinformation grow, major companies including Pfizer, Audi, and General Mills have temporarily paused their ad spending on the platform. A collection of 50 civil-society groups signed a petition urging advertisers to go further and boycott the platform entirely if its safety standards are lowered, writing that they \u201chave a moral and civic obligation to take a stand against the degradation of one of the world\u2019s most influential communications platforms.\u201d"}]}
