She\u2019s kept this schedule for as long as she can remember, even in her 20s after late nights out. Without her morning routine, \u201cmy mood isn\u2019t as stable, and I don\u2019t feel as good overall,\u201d she says\u2014and when she does sleep in, she feels like she\u2019s missed out on something."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Walsh is what researchers describe as a lark: a person who rises early and is more active in the morning, compared to a night owl who thrives after dark. Everyone has a chronotype, or circadian tendency\u2014a natural inclination to sleep and wake at a certain time. Our internal clock is about 30% to 40% dependent on genetic factors, says Philip Gehrman, a clinical psychologist who directs the Sleep, Neurobiology, and Psychopathology lab at the University of Pennsylvania. However, it\u2019s not a sure bet that \u201cif you have parents who are night owls, you\u2019re definitely going to be a night owl,\u201d he says. Research indicates that your environment, age, and sex also influence your chronotype."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The most extreme larks wake by 5:30 a.m. and go to bed around 8:30 p.m., but even getting up at 7 a.m. qualifies you as being an early riser, sleep experts say. So what if you want to become more of a morning person? People who are die-hard night owls or morning larks will typically have trouble changing their schedule and may require help from a sleep specialist. It\u2019s much like attempting to change how tall you are, says Jennifer Martin, president of the board of directors for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. But the good news is that most people don\u2019t fall on either extreme, she says\u2014and if we want (or need) to start waking up at 5 a.m., that\u2019s an achievable goal."}, {"role": "head", "text": "The health benefits of becoming a morning person"}, {"role": "body", "text": "From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that we all have different chronotypes. Our cave-sleeping ancestors needed some people to be alert in the evenings, and others in the mornings, says Britney Blair, a clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty member with the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. That ensured \u201cthe tribe was safe throughout the 24-hour period,\u201d she says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even though we no longer need to guard against wild beasts that emerge in the wee hours, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a night owl, Blair says. However, our society tends to reward morning people: \u201cSomehow, if you get up early in the morning, you\u2019re more industrious, and if you get up later, you\u2019re lazy.\u201d That\u2019s not true, of course\u2014someone might simply be more productive at 2 a.m. than at 2 p.m. Such thinking \u201cdoes a real disservice to folks who are genetically night owls, and they end up carrying that burden,\u201d Blair says."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, being an early bird may come with some health benefits. Research has linked the early-bird life to better mental health and a lower likelihood of schizophrenia and depression. Other research has found that morning people tend to be more proactive."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Plus, waking up early is often the only opportunity for some people\u2014like parents\u2014to claim time and space for themselves, says Charissa Chamorro, a New York City-based private clinical psychologist who specializes in anxiety disorders and sleep-related issues. She advises many of her clients to move their mornings earlier."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI always encourage people to pick something they enjoy that they don\u2019t feel they have time for during the day, and give themselves five minutes of that,\u201d she says. \u201cThat might be reading a novel or a magazine, or a blog\u2014anything that\u2019s rewarding to them.\u201d Meditating, or even just taking five mindful breaths, can also help start the day on a positive note, Chamorro adds."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If you\u2019re determined to rise with the sun\u2014or simply catch more of the morning\u2014know that transitioning to a new schedule requires time and effort.

(If the brightness bothers you overnight, consider wearing an eye mask that you take off as you start to wake up.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though natural light is ideal, some artificial light can also be beneficial. Sunrise alarm clocks are shaped like the sun and mimic natural morning light, instead of waking you with a jarring alarm.

In that case, Martin recommends gradually easing into the early-bird life. \u201cWhat I\u2019ll suggest to people is to shift half an hour, wait a few days, shift another half an hour, wait a few days, and then shift another half an hour,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a little easier for people to tolerate.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/morning-02.png?resize=300,300&w=300", "imageWidth": 300, "imageHeight": 300}, {"role": "head", "text": "3.

Wind down in the evenings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A consistent bedtime isn\u2019t as crucial as sticking to the same wake up time every day, Gehrman says, but it\u2019s still important to make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep. Most people should aim for at least seven hours a night\u2014so you\u2019ll probably need to inch your bedtime forward as you transition to a new schedule."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Starting at least an hour before you hit the sack, cut back on how much exposure to bright light you\u2019re getting, Gehrman advises.
