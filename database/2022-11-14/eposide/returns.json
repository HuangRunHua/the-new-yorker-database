I travelled there by train. At Motteville, we sat in the station for a long time. It was hot. It was quiet, both in the compartment and outside. I looked out the open window; the platform was empty. On the other side of the S.N.C.F. railroad barriers, the tall grass almost touched the lowest branches of the apple trees. It was then that I could really feel that I was approaching C. and that I was going to see my mother. The train continued on to C. at a reduced speed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Leaving the station, I thought I recognized various faces, without being able to put a name to any of them. Perhaps I had never known the names. It was less hot, thanks to the wind. It\u2019s always windy in C. Everyone, including my mother, believes that it\u2019s colder in C. than in other places, even those just five kilometres away."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I didn\u2019t take the taxi that was parked in front of the railway hotel, as I would have anywhere else. As soon as I\u2019m in C., I go back to my old ways: a taxi is for communions, weddings, and burials. There\u2019s no reason to spend money like that. I headed up Rue Carnot, to the town center. At the first p\u00e2tisserie, I bought cakes, \u00e9clairs, and apple tarts\u2014the kind she used to tell me to bring home after midday Mass. I bought some flowers, too, gladioli, which last a long time. Until I got to the housing complex where she lives, I didn\u2019t think anything besides, I\u2019m going to see her again and She\u2019s waiting for me."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I knocked on the narrow door of her ground-floor studio apartment. She called out, \u201cYes. Come in!\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYou should lock the door!\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI knew it was you. There\u2019s no one else it could have been.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "She was apronless, with lipstick on, laughing, standing by the table. She put her hand on my shoulder, tilting her face up for me to kiss. At the same time, she was firing off questions about my trip, the children, the dog. She didn\u2019t answer mine. Afraid of being boring, always, when speaking of herself. Later, she repeated, as usual, \u201cI\u2019m fine here. Couldn\u2019t be better\u201d and \u201cI have no complaints.\u201d The TV was on without sound, just the test pattern on the screen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She took the gladioli, a little uneasy, and thanked me with an artificial tone to her voice. I had forgotten: my giving her flowers from a florist had always seemed like an affectation to her, too formal; it hurt her feelings. It was as if I were fussing over her as I would over a stranger, not family. The cakes pleased her, but she had already bought some for us on her way back from Mass."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We sat opposite each other at the table that, along with the buffet, almost filled her apartment. I remembered what she\u2019d said the first time I\u2019d come here after she moved in: \u201cI bought it big\u2014it can seat at least ten people!\u201d Not once, in six years. . . . Nevertheless, she had covered it with an oilcloth, so as not to damage it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She was breathless, as though she had no idea where to start among all the things we had to talk about. It was dark in her studio, and there was a slight odor; she didn\u2019t air it out enough. When I was a child, she\u2019d take me with her to visit some old ladies on Sundays. Leaving their houses, she\u2019d sniff the air: \u201cIt always smells so musty in old people\u2019s homes\u2014they never open the windows.\u201d Because she used to say this, I hadn\u2019t expected her to become one of those people."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She talked about the weather in C. in the spring and the people who had died since my last visit, getting irritated with my failure to remember them, which she felt was intentional\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s that you don\u2019t want to remember.\u201d Giving me detail after detail, until I could figure out whom she meant: the person lived there, her daughter went to school with me, and so on."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We set the table at quarter to twelve. The last time, she\u2019d waited until twelve-thirty. She was accelerating everything. At one point, she said that the days of beautiful weather would soon be over."}, {"role": "body", "text": "While looking for napkins, I found a stack of romance magazines at the back of the buffet. I didn\u2019t say anything about them, but she guessed that I\u2019d seen them. \u201cThose little magazines\u2014Paulette gives them to me, otherwise you know I wouldn\u2019t read them. That\u2019s all she reads, these little stories about nothing.\u201d Still afraid that I\u2019d criticize her reading habits. I almost said that it didn\u2019t matter if she preferred Nous Deux to the Malraux she\u2019d just borrowed from the public library. She would have been unhappy if I\u2019d seemed to think her incapable of reading the kind of thing I read."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The meal passed in silence. Her eyes on her plate, her slightly sloppy movements those of someone used to eating alone. She refused to let me do the dishes. \u201cWhat will there be for me to do once you leave?\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/63628b5701aacbc004405e3b/master/w_1600,c_limit/221114_a26172.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 397}, {"role": "body", "text": "She was sitting up straight in her chair, her arms crossed. I\u2019d never seen her move her body in a natural, relaxed way; she never ran her fingers gently through her hair, never slipped a hand inside the neckline of her blouse while deep in a book. Her only gestures of abandon were expressions of fatigue: stretching with her arms above her head, slumping in a chair, her legs out in front of her. Less hardness in her face than there had been, less of that tension you need to make your way through life. Her gray eyes, which had always suspected the worst of me, were fixed on me with a hungry softness. She had been counting the days, had told herself in the morning that this was the day I was coming, and there we were, the two of us, and half our time had already passed. The tone of our visit was playful and kind. The other tone, the violence from when I was fifteen, would not return. \u201cCow, bitch, I\u2019m killing myself for her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to get the fuck out of here.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to jail first, you useless idiot.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "She tried to come up with more subjects of conversation, so that I wouldn\u2019t go too soon, leaving her alone with her desire for me, her longing to live with me, her daughter, forever. \u201cPaulette brought me some gooseberries. You wouldn\u2019t believe how good they are. It makes sense, since they\u2019re in season. Remind me to give you some before you go.\u201d Paulette\u2014a former neighbor who was my age\u2014came to see her every week; she had never left C."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Icould hear cars in the distance on the trunk road, a radio in the apartment next door, broadcasting the Tour de France, perhaps."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s peaceful.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s always peaceful here. Sundays are the quietest.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many times she had advised me to get some rest during my vacation. The sentence that used to horrify me the most when I was complaining that I didn\u2019t know what to do: \u201cJust have a little rest.\u201d Again, I felt the onset of annoyance, but her words had no power over me anymore. They only reawakened memories, the way sports radio on Sunday or an apple tart can. I could feel the boredom of summers in C.: reading from morning to night; Sunday movies, restricted or for adults only, in the three-quarters-empty theatre of the Mondial, while she thought I was out for a \u201cnice walk\u201d with an older cousin; the children\u2019s games at the street fair for local businesses; the public dance hall, which I didn\u2019t dare enter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the middle of the afternoon, a cat appeared on the windowsill of the kitchenette. She jumped up from her armchair to let it in, an \u201cadopted\u201d cat that she fed, that slept on her bed in the daytime. She was the happiest she\u2019d been since I got there. The cat kept us busy for a long time\u2014watching it, taking turns holding it. She recounted all its tricks; \u201cthe little pig\u201d clawed the curtains, and even her wrists, which were striped with red in two places. As she used to, she said, \u201cEvery living thing is beautiful.\u201d She seemed to have forgotten that I was going to leave."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the last minute, she pulled out a form that urgently needed to be filled out for her Social Security. \u201cI don\u2019t have time. Just give it to me and I\u2019ll send it to you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll take no time. You\u2019re five minutes from the station.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll miss my train.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve never missed it. You can take the next one.\u201d She was on the verge of tears. She concluded with her habitual \u201cThis is very upsetting for me.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "After kissing me at the door, she tried to keep talking. Last image of her: in the doorway, rounded arms framing her heavy silhouette in a yellow dress\u2014her prettiest one, tight around the chest and the belly\u2014a wide, fixed smile. This time, once again, I felt that I was leaving badly, in a cowardly way."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I took the shortest route to the train, the one that goes past the Shell station. There, in the old days, I\u2019d stop to prepare myself for her interrogating look when I returned from the cinema, bracing myself, wiping off what was left of my lipstick. What will people think of you?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "On the train, I couldn\u2019t help imagining her, washing the dishes in a solitary silence, all sign of my presence soon erased. I watched C. disappear\u2014the Sernam buildings, the railway workers\u2019 housing beside the tracks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A month later, I came back to see my mother. She had suffered sunstroke after Mass and had been admitted to the hospital in C. I aired out her apartment, retrieved paperwork from her buffet, threw out the perishables in her fridge. In the vegetable drawer, in a plastic bag that was knotted at the top, were the gooseberries I had forgotten to take the previous time, now just a brown, liquid heap."}]}
