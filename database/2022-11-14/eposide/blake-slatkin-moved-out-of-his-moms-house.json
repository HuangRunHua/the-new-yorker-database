The former studio was at his mother\u2019s house in Westwood, where he\u2019d lived until January. Now he was on his own. \u201cI\u2019m very slowly learning how to be an adult,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was super emotional. I was actually super nervous to move out of my mom\u2019s, because I had so much good luck there.\u201d It\u2019s where he\u2019d co-produced a large chunk of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014by Lil Nas X, The Kid LAROI, 24kGoldn, Omar Apollo, and Lizzo."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, living alone has its advantages. \u201cI mean, the morning I got my first No. 1, I woke up and I told my mom that I got my first No. 1,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she was, like, \u2018That\u2019s awesome.\u2019 And then she was, like, \u2018You have a bunch of dishes to do from last night.\u2019 \u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Slatkin traipsed past a swimming pool to his new home studio. He flopped down in a beanbag chair next to a line of guitars and keyboards. He wore a black T-shirt with the word \u201cfoolish\u201d and a silk screen of Ashanti on it, black sweatpants, and untied black Converse. \u201cI\u2019ve lived within a twenty-minute radius of here my entire life,\u201d he said. As a teen-ager, he\u2019d performed live. \u201cI\u2019d sell tickets to my shows at Whiskey a Go Go to my teachers.\u201d He left only for two years of college in Manhattan, where he\u2019d lived on St. Marks Place. \u201cI shared a wall with the show \u2018Stomp\u2019\u2014the percussion musical.\u201d He went on, \u201cFor thirty years, they\u2019ve been doing this fucking show.

I mix records on my phone all the time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "He sat down at a monitor to show how he\u2019d devised a section in a song by PinkPantheress.

LAROI was in the area and he was, like, \u2018I\u2019m coming over.\u2019 We were with Charlie Puth, and the first thing he played on the keyboard was that riff. We never changed it, even a little bit.\u201d He went on, \u201cAnd basically, in just one take, the whole song was done in thirty minutes.
