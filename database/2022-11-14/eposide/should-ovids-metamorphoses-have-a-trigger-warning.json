It comes, rather, from a notoriously risqu\u00e9 book of poems, published during the reign of the Emperor Augustus, whose narrator doles out advice on how to seduce women\u2014preferably married ones. (The first part is about where to find them; the second, about how to get them into bed; the third\u2014the part that James quoted\u2014about how to hold on to them.) The Spanish king was hardly alone in conflating this poet with a Higher Authority. The eleventh-century theologian and philosopher Abelard once cautioned against excessive harshness in monastic rule by observing that \u201cwe always chafe at restrictions and want what is forbidden\u201d\u2014sensible enough advice, except that the sentence in question was actually meant as a warning to married men that keeping too close an eye on their wives would only make them more eager to stray."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That these lines of Roman erotic verse had become indistinguishable from Scripture by the Middle Ages isn\u2019t really all that surprising. More than those of any other poet of ancient Rome, the works of Publius Ovidius Naso\u2014we know him as Ovid\u2014have insinuated themselves into the mind of Europe, influencing its literature, art, and music. Already during his lifetime, dance versions of his work were being staged, and the adaptations and borrowings have continued to the present day. Julie Taymor\u2019s notorious Broadway flop, \u201cSpider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,\u201d was an awkward riff on Ovid\u2019s tale of Arachne, the artistically talented young woman who foolishly challenged the goddess Minerva to a weaving contest and, as punishment, was turned into a spider. The poet Jericho Brown opens his 2019 collection, \u201cThe Tradition,\u201d with a poem called \u201cGanymede,\u201d in which Jove\u2019s abduction of the beautiful Trojan prince becomes a metaphor for the agonized dynamics of American slavery."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If the stories of Arachne and Ganymede are familiar to the casual reader, it\u2019s because of Ovid\u2019s greatest work, the Metamorphoses, an epic poem of fifteen books. These contain nearly two hundred and fifty mythic tales of corporeal transformation, many of which have become the canonical versions of those stories. The nymph Daphne, desperately fleeing the god Apollo, calls on her river-god father for help and is turned into a laurel tree; the lovelorn artist Pygmalion\u2019s ivory statue becomes a flesh-and-blood woman, Galatea; the nymph Echo, pining for the self-absorbed Narcissus, fades away until all that remains of her is her voice. The poet\u2019s acute insights into human psychology have given these tales a parable-like power\u2014narcissism, anyone?\u2014while the tortured physicality at the heart of his narratives has made them irresistible to artists across the centuries. \u201cLeda and the Swan\u201d alone has tempted everyone from Leonardo to C\u00e9zanne to Cy Twombly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The art, like the poem itself, is not without controversy. Bernini\u2019s \u201cApollo and Daphne,\u201d a technically superb rendering of an ugly act, has raised troubling questions about the aestheticization of violence which increasingly haunt the reception of Ovid\u2019s epic. In 2015, a group of Columbia University students demanded that trigger warnings be attached to passages from the Metamorphoses\u2014long a required text\u2014that depict rape. In so doing, they themselves triggered a national debate about \u201csnowflake\u201d students and the place of \u201cgreat books\u201d in the curriculum."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But, then, Ovid was controversial from the start. Immensely successful during his lifetime, he nonetheless drew jabs from contemporary literati who found his verbal polish and glittering wit a cover for a lack of substance\u2014a criticism that persisted well into the twentieth century. Ironically, the most famous controversy about the poet is historical rather than literary: at the height of his fame and prestige, he was suddenly exiled by Augustus to a backwater where he spent the rest of his life. The precise nature of his offense is still the subject of debate."}, {"role": "body", "text": "These controversies are now squarely addressed in a brisk new translation of the Metamorphoses from Penguin Classics, by Stephanie McCarter, a scholar of classical languages at the University of the South. McCarter confronts the tricky issues associated with both the poet and his epic not only in her forthright introduction but in the translation itself, where, like an art restorer removing decades of browned varnish from an Old Master, she strips away a number of inaccuracies and embellishments that have accreted in translations over the decades and centuries, obscuring the sense of certain passages, particularly those portraying women and sexual violence. The addition of McCarter\u2019s revisionist translation to an already crowded field\u2014half a dozen into English alone since the nineteen-eighties\u2014reminds us that Ovid and the issues that preoccupied him have never been far from the center of our culture."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The youngest, by nearly a generation, of the three greatest poets of Rome\u2019s \u201cgolden\u201d literary age, Ovid was the only one who grew up under the Empire. Both Virgil and Horace were already adults by the time the Roman Republic finally disintegrated, in the forties B.C.E., during a bloody civil war; Ovid, the second son of a wealthy landowner in Sulmo, about a hundred miles east of Rome, was born in March, 43 B.C.E., almost exactly a year after the assassination of Julius Caesar set in motion the war\u2019s final chapters. The collapse of the old order paved the way for the ascendancy of Caesar\u2019s great-nephew and adopted son, Octavian, who in 27 B.C.E., having defeated Antony and Cleopatra, his last remaining rivals for power, assumed the name Augustus and established the Empire."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like many intelligent Romans exhausted by years of civil war, Virgil and Horace could be grateful for the political and economic stability brought about by Augustus\u2019 iron grip on the state, while discreetly looking away when it came to his sometimes draconian tactics for reinforcing solid old Roman virtues. (He passed laws encouraging fertility and imposing heavy financial penalties on adulterers.) But to the next generation, especially well-off youngsters like Ovid who, in an earlier era, might have happily pursued meaningful careers in politics, the autocrat\u2019s attempts to legislate private morality no doubt seemed as risible as George H. W. Bush\u2019s \u201cfamily values\u201d campaign did to urbane twentysomethings in the nineties."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This background is crucial to understanding Ovid\u2019s literary manner and the great successes\u2014and, perhaps, the ultimate disaster\u2014it brought him. Though educated with an eye to a career in the law, the young Ovid faced his father\u2019s disapproval (\u201cEven Homer died penniless!\u201d Ovid, Sr., protested) to pursue what he felt was his natural inclination to poetry: whenever he tried to write prose, he later recalled, it came out as verse. In the mid-twenties B.C.E., while still in his late teens\u2014\u201cmy beard had only been trimmed once or twice\u201d\u2014he burst onto the literary scene with a daring collection of erotically themed poems called the Amores. The work, whose title can mean anything from \u201clove affairs\u201d to \u201cgirlfriend\u201d to \u201csex play,\u201d recounts the ups and downs of the narrator\u2019s affair with a woman he calls Corinna. Typically, Roman poems of this sort took the form of anguished erotic autobiography\u2014frustrated suitors brooding over their emotional upheavals at the hands of cruel or indifferent mistresses. In the Amores, Ovid comes close to parodying that earnest genre, toying with its conventions and expanding its boundaries to cover a range of outr\u00e9 subjects\u2014two of the poems are about abortion, one about impotence\u2014in an arch style that would have raised eyebrows coming from a mature poet, let alone a teen-ager."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Roman society was titillated, and wanted more. After the Amores came the Heroides (\u201cMythic Heroines\u201d), a series of verse letters by famous women of myth to the lovers who had abandoned them (Dido to Aeneas, Medea to Jason). These revealed a deep sympathy for women\u2019s suffering and a keen interest in female perspectives unusual for the time, qualities that were doubtless on display in his tragedy \u201cMedea,\u201d now lost, which the historian Tacitus described as one of the two most popular Roman dramas ever produced."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Ovid was in his early forties and the toast of Rome, he published his most audacious poems to date\u2014a collection that the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica once called \u201cperhaps the most immoral work ever written by a man of genius.\u201d In the Ars Amatoria, or \u201cThe Art of Love\u201d\u2014the book that would later make such an impression on James I of Aragon\u2014the poet repurposed the dignified old genre of didactic poetry in a scandalous way. Earlier poems of this type offered instruction in matters both philosophical (Lucretius\u2019 \u201cOn the Nature of Things\u201d) and practical (Virgil\u2019s Georgics gives advice about farming and beekeeping). Ovid, assuming a brittle, No\u00ebl Coward-ish pose of erotic sophistication, used the form to gleefully dispense his wisdom on seduction, complete with hints about where men could hunt for women (porticoes, theatres, the tail end of parades). Two volumes of this were soon followed by a third, in which he gives women advice on how to seduce men. Then he published \u201cRemedies for Love,\u201d in which he does an about-face and offers tips on how to fall out of love. The ability to work all sides of an argument reminds you that he\u2019d been trained as a lawyer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The timing of these books\u2019 publication was problematic, to say the least. At around the same time, Augustus\u2019 only child, Julia, was caught up in a sex scandal involving a number of high-ranking citizens. The \u201cfamily values\u201d emperor couldn\u2019t very well be seen as a hypocrite: one of Julia\u2019s lovers was forced to commit suicide and the others were exiled, as was Julia. Ovid himself believed that \u201cThe Art of Love\u201d was what got him into trouble with Augustus: he later wrote that he had been exiled because of a \u201cpoem and a mistake\u201d\u2014the poem being \u201cThe Art of Love.\u201d And yet that book was published a full ten years before the day in 8 C.E. on which the poet, now in his early fifties, was summoned to the palace, castigated by Augustus, and given twenty-four hours to leave Rome. He left behind his third wife, who seems to have worked tirelessly for his recall. (After two brief marriages, one of which produced a daughter, the erotic cynic seems finally to have found true love with a worthy partner.) Also left behind was the manuscript of the Metamorphoses, still awaiting its finishing touches, which the distraught poet apparently attempted to burn. Luckily, copies were already circulating."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It remains a mystery why, if Augustus was so offended by \u201cThe Art of Love,\u201d he waited a decade to act. Some scholars believe that the \u201cmistake\u201d Ovid referred to later was not literary but political: he may have got too close to a conspiratorial faction at court that opposed Tiberius, Augustus\u2019 chosen heir, and official outrage over the poem was merely a smoke screen to prevent news of the conspiracy from leaking out. Whatever the case may be, within months Ovid was in the tiny frontier settlement of Tomis, on the northwest coast of the Black Sea, where few people spoke Latin: a particularly cruel punishment for a poet. He died about ten years later, aged sixty, his endless pleas for a recall ignored by Tiberius, as they had been by Augustus. The exact date and circumstances of his death remain unknown."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What is not controversial about Ovid is that the poem he was laboring over before his fall from grace was a masterpiece: his only epic and a work unique in the literature of Rome, if not of the world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like some of the anomalous beings it takes such delight in describing, the Metamorphoses is a hybrid. Ovid and his contemporaries were deeply influenced by the aesthetic theories of the Greek writer Callimachus, who, rejecting the sprawling narrative arcs of epics such as the Iliad and the Odyssey, is said to have declared that \u201ca big book is a big evil.\u201d Callimachean aesthetics endorsed, by contrast, exquisiteness, brevity, and allusiveness. In the Metamorphoses, Ovid attempted something that no one had ever tried before: to compose a work whose reach recalled Homer and Virgil but that was simultaneously a Callimachean collection of artfully fashioned episodes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ovid announces the nature of his epic in its opening lines, where he asks the gods to \u201cdelicately spin out\u201d a song so vast as to be \u201cunceasing,\u201d starting with the beginning of the world and ending in the poet\u2019s own time. He opens with an evocation of the primal chaos from which all creation arose, shifting, as the poem progresses, to the establishment of Jove\u2019s rule in heaven and the creation of the human race (which, as in the Bible, has to repopulate itself after a devastating flood). There follows a panoply of myths about the interactions of gods and humans, including the many instances of divine violence against mortals which lead to all those baroque mutations."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Amid this busy sequence, the poem\u2019s chronology moves from the mythic age to human history, and the scene of its action gradually moves from Greece and the East to Italy and Rome.

The Metamorphoses often reads like a catalogue of Jove\u2019s violent offenses: Jove transforming himself into a bull in order to abduct Europa, Jove becoming a swan to get at Leda, Jove taking the form of an eagle in order to snatch up Ganymede. Homer\u2019s Zeus, fallible though he sometimes is, is always august, awesome; not so Ovid\u2019s Jove. You\u2019re more than a little uneasy when, in the poem\u2019s final vignette, Augustus is explicitly compared to that most powerful of gods: \u201cJove rules the heavens / and the tripartite world.

(He can charm trees and rocks, but famously fails to bring his wife, Eurydice, back from the dead.) The long Orpheus sequence in Book 10\u2014a mini-epic all its own\u2014is characterized by a dizzying, almost Calvinoesque series of nested narratives.

Marsyas is flayed alive for challenging Apollo to a musical contest; when the mortal Midas questions a decision in another contest, Apollo gives him an ass\u2019s ears. Art and literature, Ovid seems to say, are powerful if dangerous means of confronting arbitrary authority. In the Arachne episode, Minerva weaves a tapestry that celebrates her victory over Neptune, her uncle, in a long-ago contest for possession of Athens\u2014an egotistical bit of divine P.R. Arachne\u2019s weaving, by contrast, depicts nine rapes committed by Jove, six by Neptune, a few by Apollo and Bacchus, and one by Saturn, Jove\u2019s father.

Few poets have as instantly recognizable a style\u2014in particular, a quality of elegant fleetness that gives his verses a quicksilver shimmer. This is no easy thing to achieve in Latin, a rather heavy language. Yet Ovid managed to lighten his lines. In Latin, one way to say \u201cand\u201d is to add a short syllable, -que, to the end of the second of the two words being joined (arma virumque, \u201carms and a man\u201d); Ovid notoriously liked to pile up his -ques, a device that gives his lines a bobbing, cork-on-a-wave quality."}, {"role": "body", "text": "McCarter\u2019s translation reproduces Ovid\u2019s speed and clarity.

Even better, she is alert to many of the sparkling verbal effects for which the poet was famous in his own time. One favorite device was alliteration. In the story of the doomed lovers Pyramus and Thisbe (lifted by Shakespeare for \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d), the distraught Pyramus, thinking his beloved has died, stabs himself in the groin. Ovid compares the gush of blood to a rush of water spurting from a broken lead pipe, loading his lines with \u201cs\u201d sounds that replicate the sound of the spraying.

In Book 8, a queen named Althaea, on learning that her son has killed her brothers, finds herself torn between her maternal instinct and her sibling allegiances. Ultimately, her feeling for the ghosts of the brothers who shared her blood (consanguineas umbras) outweighs any sense of responsibility to be dutiful (pia) to her family by marriage and her child; and so she sheds his blood (sanguine), an act of appalling impiety (impietate).

To read Ovid with an eye toward his full complexity\u2014his beauty and his brutality\u2014allows us to scrutinize our own thorny relationship with the past and with the ambivalent inheritance we have received from it. To wrestle with the unsavory aspects of ancient literature is to do the hard work of self-examination."}, {"role": "body", "text": "McCarter ends her introduction with a list of her poet\u2019s themes: the fragility of the human body; the way power works; the traumatic effects of loss of agency; the dark force of the objectifying gaze; the sometimes surprising interplay among desire, gender, and the body; gender fluidity and asexuality; the human will to self-expression. If you didn\u2019t know she was writing about the concerns of someone who died twenty centuries ago, you\u2019d think her subject was still alive. As indeed he knew he would be. Vivam."}]}
