The pronouncement was, depending on your party affiliation, the severity of your polling obsession, and your Nate allegiance (Cohn, of the Times, or Silver, of FiveThirtyEight), either an overdue corrective or a clever hedge. Polls were a liberal coping device in the early days of American democratic collapse, but we now live in a post-nine-point-error-in-Wisconsin world.

He\u2019s a pollster himself, although he can be excused for the sins of his profession; in 2016, he was eleven. After witnessing the statistical whiffs of recent cycles, Shieh and his friend Patrick Chen, a fellow-senior at Phillips Academy Andover, in Massachusetts, thought they couldn\u2019t do any worse. Earlier this year, they launched the Andover Poll, which they call \u201cthe nation\u2019s first high-school-run public opinion poll.\u201d They\u2019ve been cranking out surveys regularly.

Both have impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. Shieh: campaign intern for Michelle Wu, the mayor of Boston; pole vault (varsity); Math Club (member); G.P.A., 4.0; certified therapy-dog handler (\u201cTrained the family pet, Shelby, to pass the necessary requirements\u201d).

They expected a close race for Pennsylvania\u2019s governor and a G.O.P. rout for Arizona\u2019s. \u201cPart of the thing about being, in our opinion, one of the more accurate pollsters is sometimes you get things that are surprising,\u201d Shieh said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When the results are gloomy, some poll addicts seem bothered by the fact that their level of existential dread is dictated by guys young enough to, plausibly, receive an atomic wedgie.
