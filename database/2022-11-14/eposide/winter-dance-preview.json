The designs are by Jeffrey Gibson, a visual artist of Choctaw and Cherokee descent, whose intricate and richly colored art incorporates Native American themes and techniques such as beadwork. The company also revisits one of Alexei Ratmansky\u2019s most unusual ballets, \u201cVoices,\u201d in which five female dancers perform solos that are like miniature portraits, each echoing the timbre and intonation of a different woman\u2019s voice."}]}
