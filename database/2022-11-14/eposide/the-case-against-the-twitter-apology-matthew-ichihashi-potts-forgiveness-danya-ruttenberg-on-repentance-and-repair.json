On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Jews fast and pray and repent. Jesus brought this spirit to Christianity and taught his followers to pray to God to \u201cforgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.\u201d The early Christian church developed what became the Sacrament of Reconciliation: confession, and penance. There are many steps to atonement in Islam, from admitting a wrong to making restitution and asking for God\u2019s forgiveness. Jews, Christians, and Muslims make themselves right with God. Buddhists, who worship no god, make themselves right with other people. Hindus practice Prayaschitta, rituals of absolution. Mainly, it\u2019s the forgiveness and the atonement that matter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Apology, though, has a different history. You can confess without apologizing and you can apologize without confessing, and this might be because, historically, an apology is a justification\u2014a defense, not a confession. As the philosopher Nick Smith pointed out in \u201cI Was Wrong\u201d (2008), the word \u201capology,\u201d in English, didn\u2019t suggest a statement of regret until around the sixteenth century, when, in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cRichard III,\u201d Buckingham begs Richard\u2019s pardon, for interrupting his prayers, and Richard says, \u201cThere needs no such apology.\u201d Medieval Christians practiced what the historian Thomas N. Tentler called \u201ca theology of consolation,\u201d consisting of four elements\u2014sorrow, confession, penitence, and absolution\u2014whose purpose was reconciliation with God and with the body of the faithful. In \u201cForgiveness: An Alternative Account,\u201d Matthew Ichihashi Potts, a professor of Christian morals at Harvard Divinity School, offers what he calls \u201ca modest theological defense of forgiveness.\u201d His argument follows that of the philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who, in \u201cAnger and Forgiveness\u201d (2016), argued that forgiveness isn\u2019t salutary for either party if, in order to give it, you insist on an apology. Potts calls this \u201cthe economy of apology.\u201d It\u2019s not better than vengeance, since to demand an apology and to delight in the offender\u2019s grovelling is vengeance by another name. His evidence doesn\u2019t come from Twitter; it comes mainly from novels, including Marilynne Robinson\u2019s \u201cGilead\u201d and Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved.\u201d Forgiveness, for Potts, is not an exchange\u2014forgiveness granted in return for the opportunity to witness a spectacle of abasement and self-loathing\u2014but a promise not to retaliate. Demanding an apology in exchange for forgiveness can never constitute healing, or deliver justice; it is, instead, a pleasure taken by people who delight in witnessing the suffering of those in their power (if only briefly). There is no such thing as a failed apology, then, only an abuse of power, because all forgiveness, Potts writes, \u201cbegins and ends in failure\u201d: it does not, and cannot, redeem or undo pain and loss; it can only demand the necessary attention to pain and loss, as a reckoning, as an act of grief. Forgiveness is, therefore, a species of mourning, a form of sorrow."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Within the early Christian West, acts of public supplication\u2014begging pardon\u2014required confession and might require restitution, but not the scripted public apology in the sense the SorryWatchers want. The same distinction can be made within the history of Judaism. In the twelfth century, the Spanish-born Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, known as Maimonides, wrote a commentary on the Torah and the Talmud that included a section on teshuvah, or \u201crepentance,\u201d an extended reflection on the commandment that \u201cthe sinner should repent of his sin before God and confess.\u201d But, as the Jewish historian Henry Abramson remarked in a recent study, \u201cThe Ways of Repentance,\u201d Maimonides warned against public confession that \u201ccan also be an expression of personal arrogance: \u2018Look how good I am at doing teshuvah! \u2019 \u201d Watch my apology video on YouTube!"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In \u201cOn Repentance and Repair: Making Amends in an Unapologetic World,\u201d the rabbi Danya Ruttenberg translates Maimonides into a step-by-step guide for our world, for which she provides modern-day examples.

Step four: apology. Step five: making different choices. These are kindhearted ideas, and Ruttenberg\u2019s book is full of hope and counsel about repair through restitution. But her prescriptions also come close to insisting on the suppression of dissent. She says that \u201cstarting to change,\u201d for Maimonides, might have involved \u201ctearful supplication,\u201d but that \u201cthese days this process of change might also involve therapy, or rehab, or educating oneself rigorously on an issue about which one had been ignorant or held toxic opinions.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThis book started on Twitter,\u201d Ruttenberg writes, which is something of a tip-off. \u201cTwitter gamifies communication,\u201d the philosopher C.

In the aftermath of the Second World War, churches and nation-states began issuing apologies for wartime atrocities and historical injustices. Some of the abiding principles that lie behind this postwar wave of collective apologies also found expression in \u201crestorative justice\u201d\u2014individuals making amends to their victims, sometimes as an alternative to incarceration or other kinds of force and violence. The idea gained influence in the nineteen-seventies, when it intersected with the victims-rights movement, and its particular demands for apology as remedy. And you can easily see why. Prosecutors\u2014for years, decades, centuries\u2014had failed to act on allegations of sexual misconduct, had ignored or suppressed evidence of police brutality and predatory policing; in a thousand ways, the criminal-justice system had failed women and children, had failed the poor and people of color. For some, \u201crestorative justice\u201d held out the prospect of a better path. By the nineteen-nineties, schools and juvenile-justice systems had begun using restorative-justice methods, often requiring, of public-school students, public apologies. Meanwhile, in the United States, church membership was falling from around seventy-five per cent in 1945 to less than fifty per cent by 2020. In many quarters, public acts began taking the place of religious ritual, political ideologies replacing religious faith. The national public apology took on the gravity and solemnity of a secular sacrament: Ronald Reagan apologizing, in 1988, for the imprisonment of more than a hundred thousand Japanese Americans during the Second World War (and providing limited reparations); David Cameron apologizing, in 2010, for Bloody Sunday; or the Prime Ministers of Canada apologizing, in 2008 and 2017, for the practice of taking Indigenous children from their homes and confining them to schools where, maltreated, neglected, and abused, they suffered and died."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Apology came to play a role, too, in therapy, including family therapy, in twelve-step recovery programs, and in H.R. dispute-resolution procedures. Conventions that were established for heads of states and churches making public apologies to entire peoples against whom they had committed atrocities came to be applied to apologies from one individual to another, for everything from violent crime to petty insult. The person became the collective. Eve Ensler\u2019s 2019 book, \u201cThe Apology,\u201d in which she imagines the apology her father never offered for sexually abusing her, is dedicated to \u201cevery woman still waiting for an apology.\u201d The particular injury became the universal harm. \u201cWe all cause harm,\u201d Danya Ruttenberg writes in her book on repentance. \u201cWe have all been harmed.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the origins of the Twitter apology orgy lie elsewhere, too, and especially in the idea that many kinds of speech can be harm, a conviction central to the brand of feminism founded in the nineteen-nineties by the legal theorist Catharine MacKinnon. (Her book \u201cOnly Words\u201d was published in 1993.) In 2004, in \u201cOn Apology,\u201d Aaron Lazare tried to figure out when the number of public apologies began to explode. He counted and identified a rise in the number of newspaper articles about apologizing, beginning his analysis in the early nineteen-nineties and identifying a peak in 1997-98. He found this puzzling. But, historically, it makes sense: his chronology nicely lines up with Anita Hill\u2019s testimony at the Clarence Thomas hearings, in 1991, and with the breaking of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, in 1998. Thomas maintained his innocence, and although Clinton went on television later that year and admitted to the relationship, many viewers found his apology inadequate.

Oprah and Phil Donahue staged churchy apologies in front of studio audiences, choreographed for maximum emotional intensity, and advancing the idea that every possible political, economic, or social injustice, from child abuse to police brutality and employment discrimination, could be addressed by a two-shot, a few closeups, and Kleenex. Donahue mounted an especially perverse sorrywatching spectacle in 1993. The year before, after a jury acquitted four Los Angeles policemen who beat Rodney King and riots broke out in angry, anguished protest, a group of Black men pulled Reginald O. Denny, a white man, out of his truck and beat him nearly to death. Henry Keith Watson, charged with attempted murder, was found not guilty, and was convicted only of misdemeanor assault. After Watson got out of jail, Donahue brought Denny and Watson together in front of an almost entirely white audience for a two-part apology special. \u201cAre you sorry?\u201d Donahue asked Watson, again and again, as the audience grew tense and even tenser. \u201cI apologize for my participation in the injuries you suffered,\u201d Watson said to Denny.
