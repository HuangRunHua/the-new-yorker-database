In the early twentieth century, Sergei Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes revitalized ballet, and the company remained at the forefront of the international avant-garde for decades. In this rich account, Christiansen, a critic and a self-described \u201cincurable balletomane,\u201d narrates its rise and fall under Diaghilev, a charismatic impresario whose creative orbit encompassed not only dancers, choreographers, and composers\u2014among them Nijinsky, Balanchine, and Stravinsky\u2014but also painters and writers, including Picasso and Cocteau. The professional achievements of these artists are evoked vividly, as are the personalities, romances, and rivalries whose tempestuous ebbs and flows shaped their work. Though little of the Ballets Russes repertoire survives today, Christiansen makes a convincing case for its indelible influence."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6361357dd35577fe8efae7dd/master/w_1600,c_limit/221114_r41340web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Feral City, by Jeremiah Moss (Norton).

A psychoanalyst and an anti-gentrification activist, he rails against the moneyed residents who have flocked to the city in recent years.

A young Muslim American woman named Kausar narrates this hard-bitten but glimmering d\u00e9but novel, which chronicles her negotiation of the thorny path from childhood to adulthood. The story begins in Philadelphia, with the murder of Kausar\u2019s widowed father, after which she and her sisters are relocated to New Jersey to live with an uncle who meets their practical needs, and nothing more. Asghar parses the confusion and hysteria surrounding female sexuality\u2014especially calamitous for Kausar, whose body is \u201cpretending to be a girl, even though I\u2019m not.\u201d The narrative is most affecting when Kausar turns to her faith, as when she prays, \u201cAllah, forgive me for being janky.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6361357d59f5ad8f7d4ec3a1/master/w_1600,c_limit/221114_r41342web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Solenoid, by Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu, translated from the Romanian by Sean Cotter (Deep Vellum). This book, by one of Romania\u2019s leading avant-garde writers, presents itself as the diary of an unnamed failed poet who has become a schoolteacher. He relates memories of his sickly childhood and of his walks around Bucharest (\u201ca museum of melancholy and the ruin of all things\u201d), where, in front of a morgue, he encounters so-called anti-death protesters holding signs that read \u201cNO to Being Buried Alive!\u201d The novel\u2019s title refers to a mysterious object on top of which his home is built, which causes levitation and rearranges rooms.
