I always looked for Schjeldahl\u2019s byline with tremendous anticipation. His article about the Frick Collection, in the issue of February 15 & 22, 2021, sent me to New York, where I waited outside the Madison Avenue location at 10 a.m. for the museum to open. When I revisit the collection, once renovations are completed at the mansion that houses it, in 2024, I will be thinking of Schjeldahl, who opened my eyes to both new and old artists. His vivid writing and reviews will be sorely missed."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Suzanne Kirkland"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Buffalo, N.Y."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I moderate a New Yorker discussion group that has been meeting every Tuesday morning at the public library in Weston, Connecticut, for nearly seven years. Each week, we discuss three to five articles from the most recent issue of the magazine. We try to cover the whole gamut of topics and sections, but we always picked a Schjeldahl piece if there was one. We love his use of language and his passion for art in all its forms. There were times when we thought he was beyond comprehension (some of us had to read him with a dictionary at hand), and we\u2019d sometimes laugh out loud when talking about one of his reviews. But we never considered excluding him from our discussions. We think that he did some of his best writing in the years after he announced his cancer diagnosis; what he wrote was personal and introspective and from the heart. We are saddened by his passing and will miss him terribly."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Carl Urbania"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Weston, Conn."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One of the biggest reasons that I first subscribed to The New Yorker was to read Schjeldahl\u2019s art reviews. He always inspired me to learn more and dig deeper. If vocabulary were an Olympic sport, he would have been a gold medallist. It was a joy to be in his orbit occasionally; just seeing his byline made my pulse quicken in anticipation of the most stimulating thing I would read that week."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Alisa Cox"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Seattle, Wash."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I may have been born with two left hands, but I\u2019ve always been interested in art and wanted to understand how it works. Even before I moved to New York, fifteen years ago, I relied on Schjeldahl to be my guide, and to this day his is the voice I hear when I wander the Met, the Whitney, or the Guggenheim. With humor, nuance, and just the right personal anecdote, he never failed to bring me closer to the work. Remnick\u2019s wonderful Postscript was missing only one thing: how do you pronounce Schjeldahl\u2019s last name? Thank you, Peter."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Todd Broockerd"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Brooklyn, N.Y."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This is just to say how much I will miss reading Schjeldahl\u2019s writing, which was always the first thing I turned to in The New Yorker. His enthusiasm was infectious. My appreciation for the artists whom Schjeldahl wrote about was always deepened when I read his reviews, and I frequently took the bus down to the city to catch a show.
