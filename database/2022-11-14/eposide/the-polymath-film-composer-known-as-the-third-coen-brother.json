When Burwell read the script, he worried that the violent moments might overshadow other elements of the story, which explores the escalating stubbornness of two aging men. Their conflict gradually takes on an almost supernatural dimension\u2014an effect enhanced by the seeming omniscience of an ancient neighbor, and by an unexplained drowning. \u201cMartin doesn\u2019t do anything that isn\u2019t harrowing,\u201d Burwell told me. \u201cMy daughter and I had been reading the Grimms\u2019 \u2018Cinderella,\u2019 in which the stepmother tells her daughters to cut off pieces of their feet so that they\u2019ll fit into the slipper.

His approach is much more conceptual.\u201d In the score for \u201cFargo,\u201d the Coens\u2019 sixth film, Burwell used a Hardanger fiddle, a Norwegian instrument that has two sets of strings, one of which isn\u2019t bowed but resonates with the other. (That choice was inspired by the Scandinavian names of some of the characters.) His goal was to help make a darkly improbable comedy seem as straightforward as a news bulletin, an effect established with the title sequence, in which a car is being towed across a white-out winter landscape, accompanied by a fiddle-and-percussion passage that swells into something like a funeral march. Ethan Coen told me, \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much of what they\u2019re getting from a movie is from the score, delivered by the composer. It\u2019s powerful, but, for the life of you, you can\u2019t say what it means.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Music is almost always one of the last elements added to a movie, and, as a consequence, the composer is often called on to address issues that the director no longer can.

In one scene, a young woman has an angry confrontation with a Coast Guard officer, who she believes has doomed her fianc\u00e9 and three other sailors by sending them, in a small motorboat, to rescue the tanker\u2019s crew. \u201cPlease call them back,\u201d she begs, repeatedly.

It was too late to reshoot the scene, so the director turned to Burwell. \u201cThe last\u2014and, certainly, cheapest\u2014way to solve a problem is to have the composer adjust the emotion,\u201d Burwell told me. He was able to resolve the issue by slightly altering the score. \u201cI added a minor seventh chord,\u201d he explained. \u201cI had to create this extra angst, kind of juice it up, so that you could feel her blood boiling.

His score, like the script, has a sense of humor: during a scene in which Nicolas Cage\u2019s character steals a package of diapers from a convenience store, the song playing over the speakers is a Muzak-like version of the movie\u2019s main theme. Burwell also incorporated whistling, humming, yodelling, and a banjo. (The Coens had credibility, but their budget was still small. The banjo player was their optometrist.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of Burwell\u2019s music for the Coens provides a counterpoint to their world view. \u201cTheir writing is ironic, even cynical, and a lot of their stories are structured to torture their characters,\u201d he told me. \u201cSo one of the roles of music in their films is to augment the humanity of those characters, and when that works it makes the humor\u2014and the torture\u2014more effective and consequential.\u201d When \u201cRaising Arizona\u201d came out, a reviewer praised Burwell\u2019s \u201cyearning strings,\u201d and that phrase became the Coens\u2019 shorthand for injections of musical warmth. \u201cThis usually happens when the characters realize how fucked they are,\u201d Burwell said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Their next film, \u201cMiller\u2019s Crossing,\u201d which was released in 1990, makes striking use of what\u2019s known as diegetic music\u2014music that can be heard by a movie\u2019s characters as well as by its audience. There\u2019s an extended sequence in which an Irish Mob boss, played by Albert Finney, is lying in bed in his bathrobe, smoking a cigar and listening to a 78-r.p.m. record of the sappy classic \u201cDanny Boy.\u201d Two hit men come looking for him, but he manages to kill them, then uses one of their submachine guns to fire at their fleeing accomplices.
