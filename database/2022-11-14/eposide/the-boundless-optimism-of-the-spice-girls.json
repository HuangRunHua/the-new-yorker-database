The producers were hoping to assemble an all-female pop group as a counterpoint to the windswept boy bands (Take That, Boyzone) then topping the U.K. charts. The scheme was not novel, or even particularly nuanced: a gang of cute, vivacious girls, some choreography, a few rousing choruses. \u201cR.U. 18-23 with the ability to sing/dance? R.U. streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, & dedicated?\u201d the ad asked. The trio auditioned some four hundred women, chose five, and soon decreed them the Spice Girls. The new group moved into a three-bedroom house in Maidenhead and began the sort of rigorous yet artless performance training that\u2019s now a hallmark of the pop-band origin story. Each member (Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, and Victoria Adams, later Beckham) assumed a descriptive moniker (Scary Spice, Sporty Spice, Baby Spice, Ginger Spice, and Posh Spice). Chris Herbert, who was then just twenty-three, later spoke about the process as though he were creating a children\u2019s cartoon. \u201cThe main thing was to get really good, sassy, colorful, bubbly characters,\u201d he explained in the 2001 documentary \u201cRaw Spice.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the summer of 1996, the Spice Girls released a d\u00e9but album, \u201cSpice.\u201d The dominant vibe of the boy bands of the time was a kind of grandiose romance: lovelorn bangers, sung by handsome men in loose-fitting blouses, making dramatic gestures with their hands. The Spice Girls\u2019 first single, \u201cWannabe,\u201d is a difficult track to describe, as it does not hew to any songwriting conventions, or to the laws of gravity. \u201cThey made all these different bits up, not thinking in terms of verse, chorus, bridge,\u201d Matt Rowe, one of their co-writers, said later. \u201cJust coming up with all these sections of chanting, rapping, and singing, which we recorded all higgledy-piggledy.\u201d I was sixteen when \u201cWannabe\u201d was released, and I recall being agog at the song\u2019s lunatic pre-chorus, which contains a nearly Joycean meditation on desire:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Yo, I\u2019ll tell you what I want, what I really, really want "}, {"role": "quote", "text": "So tell me what you want, what you really, really want "}, {"role": "quote", "text": "I wanna (hey!), I wanna (hey!), I wanna (hey!), I wanna (hey!)

In 2014, a team of Dutch research scientists suggested that it might be the catchiest song ever recorded. The track appears to include instruments, but whatever is happening musically is rendered irrelevant by the Girls\u2019 bursts of jaunty rapping and hype-man whoops. The Spice Girls were not the most exacting performers, but they were brassy and buoyant. In the video for \u201cWannabe,\u201d even Posh Spice\u2014forever bedecked in a tiny Gucci dress and strappy heels, rarely smiling in photos\u2014bounds around like a toddler who has got hold of some chocolate doughnuts."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1996, there was plenty of room on the pop charts for whimsy; the most popular song of the year was a bouncy remix of \u201cMacarena.\u201d In a few years, the Zeitgeist would bend back toward wounded male earnestness\u2014Creed\u2019s \u201cWith Arms Wide Open,\u201d 3 Doors Down\u2019s \u201cKryptonite\u201d\u2014but, for a brief moment, every time \u201cWannabe\u201d came on the radio, life resembled a teen-age slumber party, where some intrepid attendee had pinched a bottle of peach schnapps, and there was a very long list of lame adults to prank call."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though \u201cWannabe\u201d had all the markings of a one-off hit, \u201cSpice\u201d generated three Top Five singles in the U.S., and the Spice Girls became a global phenomenon, preaching girl power\u2014a vague marketing notion, even then\u2014and a boundless, unquestioning jocularity. In 1997, the group released a second album, \u201cSpiceworld.\u201d It set a record for the fastest-selling album by a girl group, with seven million copies shipped in the first two weeks. The band travelled to South Africa to perform a charity concert, and met with Nelson Mandela. \u201cYou know, these are my heroes,\u201d Mandela told a scrum of reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the greatest moments in my life.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cSpiceworld\u201d is now twenty-five years old. On the occasion of its anniversary, the album is being reissued with bonus tracks, B-sides, and live recordings from the band\u2019s 1997-98 tour, all culled from the Virgin Records archive. The record includes both a demo and a remix of \u201cStep to Me,\u201d which was originally obtainable only by twisting twenty pink soda tabs off promotional cans of Pepsi and trading them in for a CD single, and something called \u201cSpice Girls Party Mix,\u201d a fifteen-minute medley of the group\u2019s up-tempo hits, somehow made even more up-tempo. (I found it difficult to listen to without wanting to submerge my head in ice water, simply for the quiet.) The live material is more vibrant, though it might leave a listener craving lights, costumes, and dancing; the Spice Girls still work best as a multisensory presentation."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cSpiceworld\u201d does not attempt to transcend \u201cSpice\u201d but, rather, to expand upon it in a lateral way. As recording technology has evolved, pop production has become more impermeable, and fingerprints tend to be erased or smoothed over. \u201cSpiceworld\u201d is the sort of pop record that doesn\u2019t really get made anymore: sentimental, infinitely palatable, but also plainly imperfect, with wobbly vocals and canned backing tracks. None of these songs are especially adventurous. (The most stylistically ambitious moment on \u201cSpiceworld\u201d is the weepy breakup ballad \u201cViva Forever,\u201d which includes a bit of flamenco-esque guitar.) The Girls\u2019 limitations are still central to the record\u2019s appeal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "From the start, the Spice Girls\u2019 mission was to spread a kind of anodyne, generalized positivity; in 1997, this may have seemed like a timeless goal, but, twenty-five years later, it\u2019s probably what makes \u201cSpiceworld\u201d feel the most dated. Na\u00efvet\u00e9 of this sort is almost impossible to access now, in an era in which we are constantly reminded of suffering, both planetary and human. In the music video for \u201cSpice Up Your Life,\u201d the album\u2019s first single, the Spice Girls steer a spacecraft through a post-apocalyptic cityscape. An icy gray rain is falling. Faces are wan, despairing. Prisoners nod off against the bars of their cells.

Perhaps the group knew this then. As you watch the video, it\u2019s easy to presume that the Girls are about to transform the streets with their upbeat attitudes, but the ship keeps simply drifting overhead. (It\u2019s tempting to read this as a metaphor for futility, but to search too deeply for meaning is, of course, antithetical to the Spice Girls project.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 1998, Halliwell (Ginger Spice) departed the group, announcing, through her lawyer, \u201cSadly I would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls. This is because of differences between us.\u201d The remaining members got to work on solo records. The band\u2014without Halliwell\u2014released a third and final album, \u201cForever,\u201d in 2000. Since then, artists such as Adele and Haim have cited the Spice Girls as influential, and there are echoes of the group\u2019s music in K-pop acts such as Girls Generation and Blackpink, and in so-called girl-boss feminism, in which the pursuit of power is reconfigured as righteous. But the band\u2019s greatest legacy may be the way in which it encapsulated\u2014possibly even dictated\u2014the grinning innocence of the late nineties. Empowerment anthems, once omnipresent on the pop charts, have slowly given way to admissions of helplessness or self-incrimination; even Taylor Swift\u2019s most recent single, \u201cAnti-Hero,\u201d contains a moment of radical self-doubt. (\u201cIt\u2019s me, hi, I\u2019m the problem, it\u2019s me,\u201d Swift sings.) In this way, \u201cSpiceworld\u201d is a comforting evocation of a bygone era, in which we could still declare ourselves magnificent without rolling our eyes."}]}
