In 2012, while in Minnesota campaigning for re\u00eblection, President Barack Obama recounted his \u201ctussles\u201d with obstructionist Republicans in Congress before indulging in a bit of wishful thinking. \u201cI believe that if we\u2019re successful in this election,\u201d he said, \u201cthe fever may break, because there\u2019s a tradition in the Republican Party of more common sense than that.\u201d Not to spoil it for anyone who hasn\u2019t been following along at home, but the fever did not break. Still, Joe Biden struck the same note in 2019, while campaigning in New Hampshire. \u201cWith Donald Trump out of the White House\u2014not a joke\u2014you will see an epiphany occur among many of my Republican friends,\u201d he said. But, as President, Biden started to see the light\u2014or the dying of it. In September, he gave a speech, in Philadelphia, asserting that \u201cequality and democracy are under assault.\u201d Last Wednesday, he spoke again, a few blocks from the Capitol. \u201cAs I stand here today, there are candidates running for every level of office in America\u2014for governor, Congress, attorney general, secretary of state\u2014who won\u2019t commit, they will not commit, to accepting the results of elections that they are running in,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a path to chaos in America.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The sitting President\u2019s party has lost congressional seats in nearly every midterm election of the past century. When it first happened to Obama, in 2010, he referred to it as a \u201cshellacking.\u201d This shellacking season, the Republicans have no shortage of issues to run on (inflation, Biden\u2019s abject approval ratings), and an expanding array of systemic advantages (the anti-democratic structure of the Senate, the widening asymmetry of gerrymandering, the suppressive spirit of several states\u2019 post-2020 voting laws). But there\u2019s at least a chance that, with enough Democratic turnout, all of this can be overcome. So some Trumpist Republicans have been flirting with another anti-democratic tactic: tacitly exploiting, or even encouraging, an atmosphere of political violence."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Trump, of course, has long revelled in threats of brute force, both veiled and explicit. After each new incitement, G.O.P. leaders have gone through the familiar cycle: consternation, equivocation, whataboutism, and, finally, full capitulation. The result has been a normalization of political violence: \u201cJanuary 6th was a normal tourist visit\u201d is the new Lost Cause dogma, and Republicans who dissent are re\u00ebducated or excommunicated. It\u2019s impossible to predict how all this will end, and it would be irresponsible to draw too direct a line between the rhetorical climate and any individual\u2019s actions. But, obviously, none of it bodes well."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Late last month, in the middle of the night, a forty-two-year-old man entered the San Francisco home of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, by shattering a glass door with a hammer. She wasn\u2019t there, but her eighty-two-year-old husband was; in the moments before the intruder was arrested, he used the hammer to bash Paul Pelosi\u2019s skull. The next day, Hillary Clinton tweeted a link to a Los Angeles Times article reporting that the assailant had spread \u201cfar-right, bigoted conspiracies.\u201d Elon Musk\u2014the new owner of Twitter, the world\u2019s richest man, and, these days, a folk hero of the far right\u2014replied to Clinton\u2019s tweet, linking to a piece from the Santa Monica Observer, a gossip site filled with salacious clickbait, which speculated that the assault was not a political attack but a hookup gone wrong. The Observer later took down the story; Musk deleted his tweet, but he didn\u2019t apologize or issue a correction. \u201cTwitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences,\u201d he had tweeted on the day he took over the company, shortly before amplifying defamatory misinformation with no consequences. Trump, days later, mused that \u201cthe glass, it seems, was broken from the inside to the out, so it wasn\u2019t a break-in, it was a breakout.\u201d According to the police, this is flatly false, but what difference does that make?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The right doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on political violence, of course. Perhaps the most analogous incident in recent memory is the 2017 shooting, by a disturbed gunman who identified with the left, of the Republican congressman Steve Scalise and several others. After that attack, prominent Democrats expressed unqualified condemnation, and sympathy for the victims. After the attack on Paul Pelosi, some Republican officials issued thoughts and prayers; others, such as Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, found a way to blame both sides (\u201cThis is what Democrat policies are bringing, but of course we wish Paul Pelosi a recovery\u201d). Still others (Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas; Representative Clay Higgins, of Louisiana) treated the incident as fodder for fatuous conspiracy theories, or as a gruesome punch line."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It\u2019s a journalistic clich\u00e9, but a useful exercise: imagine that all this were happening in another country. A political leader, the object of years of menacing rhetoric, is targeted; the opposition party vacillates between downplaying the incident and playing it for cheap laughs. This is also a country with more guns than people, and more than ten mass shootings in an average week. And one where, year after year, voting gets harder, especially for poor people and racial minorities. How would you rate that country\u2019s long-term democratic prospects?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last week, Brazil held a runoff Presidential election between Jair Bolsonaro, the proto-authoritarian incumbent, and Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the leftist former President. Gun ownership had spiked under Bolsonaro, and the months leading up to the election were extraordinarily tense. The journalism nonprofit Ag\u00eancia P\u00fablica recorded more than three hundred incidents of election-related violence, including at least fifteen murders and twenty-three assassination attempts. Lula won, by less than two percentage points, and supporters of Bolsonaro, who has insisted for years that the voting system is rigged, took to the streets, demanding that the military overturn the result. Bolsonaro stayed silent for two days, and even then did not formally concede; he distanced himself from \u201cthe destruction of property\u201d and other forms of protest, but did not tell his supporters to stand down. Once he is stripped of Presidential immunity, he could face charges of mishandling public funds and recklessly endangering his citizens during the pandemic, accusations he dismisses. But he may be calculating that he can benefit from mass unrest, and from the perception that there is no way to hold him accountable without tearing the country apart."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If this sounds like the kind of thing that can happen only in a relatively young democracy, consider that nearly every move Bolsonaro has made is one first used by Trump. \u201cThis is a path to chaos in America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, it\u2019s unlawful, and it\u2019s un-American.\u201d Chaos? Absolutely. Un-American? Maybe."}]}
