My mum\u2019s Scottish, so the Presbyterian thing is strong within me.\u201d That same year, Thompson presented the American Film Institute\u2019s Life Achievement Award to Mike Nichols, whom she referred to as \u201cmy second father.\u201d (Nichols cast her as the Hilary Clinton character in his film adaptation of \u201cPrimary Colors\u201d (1998); as the eponymous divine messenger in his HBO production of Tony Kushner\u2019s \u201cAngels in America\u201d (2003); and\u2014in one of the most extraordinary of her nuanced characterizations\u2014as the sardonic English professor dying of ovarian cancer in his HBO film \u201cWit\u201d (2001), for which Thompson and Nichols co-wrote the script, based on Margaret Edson\u2019s play.) Addressing Nichols directly, she said, \u201cYou and I share the same kind of conscience that both longs for and deplores approval.\u201d Then, from beside the lectern, she produced a hand-painted wooden box, which she called the \u201cPost-Tribute Punishment Kit.\u201d On one side, in large black lettering, was written \u201cPortable Chastisement at Last.\u201d She dug around inside the box, pulled out a flail, and began whipping her back. \u201cOw!

She spoke about Nanny McPhee\u2019s mission to bring order, by unorthodox means, to a grief-stricken household full of anarchic children acting out their fury at losing their mother and, in a way, losing their father, who seems preoccupied and unable to cope. There were clear parallels with her own childhood. \u201cThat happened to us when our dad died,\u201d she said. \u201cOur mum couldn\u2019t\u2014absolutely couldn\u2019t\u2014cope with our grief, couldn\u2019t cope with us, couldn\u2019t cope at all. Nanny McPhee is a great heroic presence. She knows exactly what to do, loves without reservation, then must go. So she sacrifices. She always has to leave those that she loves.

And what about Nanny McPhee herself? \u201cIf we\u2019re moving toward this sense of her stitching up these torn lives, each one has to have a moment with her, some sort of magic, healing touch.
