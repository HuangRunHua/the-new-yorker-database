It brought me great sadness to learn of the art critic Peter Schjeldahl’s death, from David Remnick’s remembrance of his wondrous life and writing (Postscript, October 31st). I always looked for Schjeldahl’s byline with tremendous anticipation. His article about the Frick Collection, in the issue of February 15 & 22, 2021, sent me to New York, where I waited outside the Madison Avenue location at 10 a.m. for the museum to open. When I revisit the collection, once renovations are completed at the mansion that houses it, in 2024, I will be thinking of Schjeldahl, who opened my eyes to both new and old artists. His vivid writing and reviews will be sorely missed.

I moderate a New Yorker discussion group that has been meeting every Tuesday morning at the public library in Weston, Connecticut, for nearly seven years. Each week, we discuss three to five articles from the most recent issue of the magazine. We try to cover the whole gamut of topics and sections, but we always picked a Schjeldahl piece if there was one. We love his use of language and his passion for art in all its forms. There were times when we thought he was beyond comprehension (some of us had to read him with a dictionary at hand), and we’d sometimes laugh out loud when talking about one of his reviews. But we never considered excluding him from our discussions. We think that he did some of his best writing in the years after he announced his cancer diagnosis; what he wrote was personal and introspective and from the heart. We are saddened by his passing and will miss him terribly.

One of the biggest reasons that I first subscribed to The New Yorker was to read Schjeldahl’s art reviews. He always inspired me to learn more and dig deeper. If vocabulary were an Olympic sport, he would have been a gold medallist. It was a joy to be in his orbit occasionally; just seeing his byline made my pulse quicken in anticipation of the most stimulating thing I would read that week.

I may have been born with two left hands, but I’ve always been interested in art and wanted to understand how it works. Even before I moved to New York, fifteen years ago, I relied on Schjeldahl to be my guide, and to this day his is the voice I hear when I wander the Met, the Whitney, or the Guggenheim. With humor, nuance, and just the right personal anecdote, he never failed to bring me closer to the work. Remnick’s wonderful Postscript was missing only one thing: how do you pronounce Schjeldahl’s last name? Thank you, Peter.

This is just to say how much I will miss reading Schjeldahl’s writing, which was always the first thing I turned to in The New Yorker. His enthusiasm was infectious. My appreciation for the artists whom Schjeldahl wrote about was always deepened when I read his reviews, and I frequently took the bus down to the city to catch a show. I am feeling bereft; something important and wonderful is gone from my life.

I read Schjeldahl slowly, in great awe, and with a feeling that I was having a sublime experience, even when I didn’t know the artists he focussed on. He took me by the hand and led me through the galleries. I shall miss his art and his passion and his sense of authority so very much.
