Diaghilev’s Empire, by Rupert Christiansen (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). In the early twentieth century, Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes revitalized ballet, and the company remained at the forefront of the international avant-garde for decades. In this rich account, Christiansen, a critic and a self-described “incurable balletomane,” narrates its rise and fall under Diaghilev, a charismatic impresario whose creative orbit encompassed not only dancers, choreographers, and composers—among them Nijinsky, Balanchine, and Stravinsky—but also painters and writers, including Picasso and Cocteau. The professional achievements of these artists are evoked vividly, as are the personalities, romances, and rivalries whose tempestuous ebbs and flows shaped their work. Though little of the Ballets Russes repertoire survives today, Christiansen makes a convincing case for its indelible influence.

Feral City, by Jeremiah Moss (Norton). This diary of the first year of the covid-19 pandemic in New York City is ruminative, provocative, and moving. Moss, a transsexual man who calls himself a “queer refugee,” moved to the East Village in the early nineteen-nineties. A psychoanalyst and an anti-gentrification activist, he rails against the moneyed residents who have flocked to the city in recent years. His account centers on the “wild possibilities”—such as the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place in the wake of the killing of George Floyd—that emerged when the pandemic drove away those newcomers. Moss laments New York’s return to normalcy with the delivery of vaccines: “It’s the city being put back to sleep.”

When We Were Sisters, by Fatimah Asghar (One World). A young Muslim American woman named Kausar narrates this hard-bitten but glimmering début novel, which chronicles her negotiation of the thorny path from childhood to adulthood. The story begins in Philadelphia, with the murder of Kausar’s widowed father, after which she and her sisters are relocated to New Jersey to live with an uncle who meets their practical needs, and nothing more. Asghar parses the confusion and hysteria surrounding female sexuality—especially calamitous for Kausar, whose body is “pretending to be a girl, even though I’m not.” The narrative is most affecting when Kausar turns to her faith, as when she prays, “Allah, forgive me for being janky.”

Solenoid, by Mircea Cărtărescu, translated from the Romanian by Sean Cotter (Deep Vellum). This book, by one of Romania’s leading avant-garde writers, presents itself as the diary of an unnamed failed poet who has become a schoolteacher. He relates memories of his sickly childhood and of his walks around Bucharest (“a museum of melancholy and the ruin of all things”), where, in front of a morgue, he encounters so-called anti-death protesters holding signs that read “NO to Being Buried Alive!” The novel’s title refers to a mysterious object on top of which his home is built, which causes levitation and rearranges rooms. As in the work of Kafka, whose diaries the narrator adores, the book’s horror and humor are born from examining “the tragic anomaly of the spirit dressed in flesh.”
