“Thierry Mugler: Couturissime,” opening at the Brooklyn Museum on Nov. 18, celebrates the career of the provocative French designer, who counted Grace Jones, Tippi Hedren, Lypsinka, Ivana Trump, and Cardi B among his muses. (Mugler died in January, at the age of seventy-three.) Some hundred and thirty outfits are accompanied by accessories, sketches, a hologram, photos—including this shot of an embroidered velvet suit from the Fall/Winter 1990-91 collection, “Music-Hall”—and a room devoted to fragrance.
