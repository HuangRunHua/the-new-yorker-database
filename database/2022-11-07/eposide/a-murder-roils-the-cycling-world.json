Columbia County occupies an edge of the state\u2019s northeastern coal region. Mastriano, who is tall and bald, wore a black baseball hat. His wife, Rebbie, a chaplain, stood at his right hand, her jean jacket unzipped. Mastriano reminded the audience that he was running only because, a year earlier, in this very barn, a small group of followers had begged him to. \u201cYou urged us, even with tears in your eyes, \u2018Please run for governor,\u2019 \u201d he said.

Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican legislature has tried to ban abortion, but it has been blocked by the Democratic governor, Tom Wolf. Mastriano has promised to outlaw the procedure without exception, and to prosecute women who get abortions and doctors who perform them for murder. Perhaps most notably, in 2020, Mastriano was one of the architects of the attempt to overturn the results of the Presidential election and award Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes to Donald Trump. On January 6, 2021, he attended the insurrection at the Capitol.

The shape of the Pennsylvania legislature could decide the future of reproductive access and voting rights in the state.

The legislature has been under G.O.P. control for nearly twenty-five years. This is, in part, a result of the fact that Republican voters historically turn out for midterm elections at higher rates than Democrats. \u201cIf you scrape together five to ten thousand dollars from acquaintances at your church or rod-and-gun club, you can knock on one thousand doors and win,\u201d Mittleman said. The oil-and-gas and insurance industries pumped money into Republican campaigns to swing the legislature. In 2011, Republican lawmakers carved some of the most misshapen districts in the nation.

Trump also stoked distrust of the government. Pennsylvanians\u2019 level of trust in state and federal politicians is among the lowest in the country. Katie Muth, a Democratic state senator, told me, \u201cI don\u2019t trust the government, and I\u2019m in it.\u201d In 2020, pandemic lockdowns intensified the anger of those who felt squeezed. \u201cThat\u2019s when the bitterness began,\u201d Stevens, of We the People, told me.
