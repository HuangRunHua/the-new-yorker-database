## ELON MUSK@elonmusk
This is a battle for the future of civilization. If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.

## JustMeCuzI’mEnough@PrioritizeMentalHealth
What if we all just thought about climate change while sharing pictures of meadows instead of calling me names like FlowerButt and You Idiot

## KindnessIsReal@ILoveEveryone
I hate people who are divisive, spreading misinformation and hate. What if we forget our differences? And if you disagree I hear you and respect you, and I hope you get run down by a truck filled with compassion and guns
