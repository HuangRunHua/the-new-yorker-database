There are twenty-five prime numbers between one and a hundred, but as you count higher they become increasingly rare.

Like so many concepts in physics, entanglement was first described in one of Einstein\u2019s Gedankenexperiments. Quantum mechanics dictated that the properties of particles assumed fixed values only once they were measured. Before that, a particle existed in a \u201csuperposition\u201d of many states at once, which were described using probabilities. (A famous thought experiment, proposed by the physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, imagined a cat trapped in a box with a quantum-activated vial of poison, the cat superpositioned in a state between life and death.) This disturbed Einstein, who spent his later years formulating objections to the \u201cnew physics\u201d of the generation that had succeeded him. In 1935, working with the physicists Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, he revealed an apparent paradox in quantum mechanics: if one took the implications of the discipline seriously, it should be possible to create two entangled particles, separated by any distance, that could somehow interact faster than the speed of light. \u201cNo reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this,\u201d Einstein and his colleagues wrote. In subsequent decades, however, the other predictions of quantum mechanics were repeatedly verified in experiments, and Einstein\u2019s paradox was ignored. \u201cBecause his views went against the prevailing wisdom of his time, most physicists took Einstein\u2019s hostility to quantum mechanics to be a sign of senility,\u201d the historian of science Thomas Ryckman wrote."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Mid-century physicists focussed on particle accelerators and nuclear warheads; entanglement received little attention.

Against the advice of his professors\u2014including Richard Feynman\u2014he decided to run an experiment that would vindicate Einstein, by proving that the theory of quantum mechanics was incomplete.

Clauser and Stuart Freedman, his co-author, published their findings in 1972. From Clauser\u2019s perspective, the experiment was a disappointment: he had definitively proved Einstein wrong. Eventually, and with great reluctance, Clauser accepted that the baffling rules of quantum mechanics were, in fact, valid, and what Einstein considered a grotesque affront to human intuition was merely the way the universe works. \u201cI confess even to this day that I still don\u2019t understand quantum mechanics,\u201d Clauser said, in 2002."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But Clauser had also demonstrated that entangled particles were more than just a thought experiment.

Many of these businesses are speculative. IonQ , based in College Park, Maryland, went public last year, despite having almost no sales. Researchers there compute with qubits obtained using the \u201ctrapped ion\u201d approach, arranging atoms of the rare-earth element ytterbium into a tidy row, then manipulating them with a laser. Jungsang Kim, IonQ\u2019s C.T.O., told me that his ion traps maintain entanglement better than Google\u2019s processors, but he admitted that, as more qubits are added, the laser system gets more complicated. \u201cImproving the controller, that\u2019s kind of our sticking point,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At PsiQuantum, in Palo Alto, engineers are making qubits from photons, the weightless particles of light. \u201cThe advantage of this approach is that we use pre\u00ebxisting silicon-fabrication technology,\u201d Pete Shadbolt, the company\u2019s chief scientific officer, said. \u201cAlso, we can operate at somewhat higher temperatures.\u201d PsiQuantum has raised half a billion dollars. There are other, weirder approaches. Microsoft, building on Kitaev\u2019s work, is attempting to construct a \u201ctopological\u201d qubit, which requires synthesizing an elusive particle in order to work. Intel is trying the \u201csilicon spin\u201d approach, which embeds qubits in semiconductors. The competition has led to bidding wars for talent. \u201cIf you have an advanced degree in quantum physics, you can go out into the job market and get five offers in three weeks,\u201d Kim said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Even the most optimistic analysts believe that quantum computing will not earn meaningful profits in the next five years, and pessimists caution that it could take more than a decade.

His laboratory is expensive, and quantum computing is the kind of moon-shot project that thrived during the era of low interest rates. \u201cBecause of the present financial situation, startups in our field have more difficulties finding investors,\u201d Devoret, the experimental physicist, told me. But, as long as Amazon is investing in quantum computing, it\u2019s a good bet that Google will keep funding it, too. There is also the tacit support of the state\u2014the U.S. intelligence apparatus has made quantum decryption a priority, regardless of market fluctuations. In fact, Neven\u2019s stiffest competition comes not from the private sector but from the Chinese Communist Party.

In a paper published in Science, in 2020, a team led by the scientists Lu Chao-Yang and Pan Jian-Wei announced that their processor had solved a computational task millions of times faster than the best supercomputer. Pan is one of the most daring researchers in quantum entanglement. In 2017, his team ran an experiment that entangled two photons at an observatory in Tibet, and transmitted one of them to an orbiting satellite. The scientists then transferred attributes from a third photon on Earth to the one in space, using the technique of \u201cquantum teleportation.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Lu and I spoke by video earlier this year.

From there, Google plans to scale up its computing effort by chaining processors together. Adjacent to the warehouse I visited was a second, bigger space, where sunshine streamed into a dusty construction site. There, Google plans to build a computer that will require a freezer as large as a one-car garage. A thousand fault-tolerant qubits should be enough to run accurate simulations of molecular chemistry. Ten thousand fault-tolerant qubits could begin to unlock new findings in particle physics. From there, researchers could start to run Shor\u2019s algorithm at full power, exposing the secrets of our era. \u201cIt\u2019s quite possible that I will die before it happens,\u201d Shor, who is sixty-three, told me. \u201cBut I would really like to see it happen, and I think it\u2019s also quite possible that I will live long enough to see it.\u201d"}]}
