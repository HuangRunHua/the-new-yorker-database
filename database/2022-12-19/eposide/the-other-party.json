She came into the kitchen limping a little, her mascara smeared, and lay down on the floor in front of the stove. I was dipping a cookie in icing, checking the color to see if it needed more green. Every year, in December, our block had a Christmas-cookie swap, a ritual that had become one of the less disgusting parts of the holiday season."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I was home a lot and took care of things, the cooking and the house stuff. Before being home a lot, I\u2019d worked on a TV show in Los Angeles. It was shot on two gigantic stages at a movie studio in Burbank, near a building shaped like a wizard hat that you could see from the Ventura Freeway. I was out there for a year, living in a canyon above Sunset, and missed my kid so badly that when I passed the playground of the elementary school in Toluca Lake I had to pull over, smoke a cigarette, and cry."}, {"role": "body", "text": "All day long, a dozen of us sat around a big table in a dark room writing a soapy drama about an inner-city hospital, for a guy who\u2019d optioned my novel and wanted me to learn the ropes. He said I had potential, and he thought of what he was giving me as a priceless education, one that came with specific instructions\u2014like a Faberg\u00e9 egg he wanted me to stick up my ass, to keep it safe. But then he got angry and forgot about the egg and kicked me so hard that it shattered, and while I was bleeding to death he blamed me for breaking it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When he fired me, I came home, and a few months later the pandemic hit. I did the shopping and the driving and the cleaning. I figured out how to vacuum inside the radiator, and at night I\u2019d close my eyes and see the top rack of the dishwasher. My wife, Monica, moved her practice online, and I\u2019d hear her down in the basement, not the words or even the tone so much as the endlessness of it, with her patients onscreen, in states of dislocation and despair, as she put in more hours than she had in her entire life. Before the TV show, I\u2019d been a serious writer with big ambitions, but supporting a family was a whole other thing. I lived in a little cage now, which I\u2019d built for myself, and I was comfortable in it. I was like a housekeeper who folded underpants and got laid. My wife was either the customer or the boss: she and our daughter came first, and everything hinged on nobody being mad at me. In the spring, we got vaccinated, and, in the fall, they went back to school and the office."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I was examining the test cookie in the light, by a window that overlooked a row of back yards, while listening to Christmas music and wondering when to start dinner. I felt protected by the holiday, and by this baking and the neighborly union to come. Like our Labor Day block party, which featured beer pong and a spoon race, the cookie party made the world feel smaller and saner, and I was happy to have Rachel safely at home, and Brendan in the doorway, looking down at her with a stupid expression. We referred to this flopping-down-anywhere thing she sometimes did as \u201cfloor time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "They\u2019d ridden their bikes home from school. And even though it was cold and rainy and the middle of December, Rachel was wearing a tank top, a pink-and-white miniskirt, yellow platform sneakers, and a little furry gray jacket. She was fifteen, and tanned, because she swam on a team that practiced outdoors all winter in a heated pool. The dog came in and sniffed her smooth golden legs while she stared up at the ceiling through greenish-pinkish makeup I\u2019d never seen before. The dog leaned in and licked her eye. She screamed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Brendan stepped over her and sat at the table. He looked at the cookies. He played basketball and was about six feet four and a hundred and thirty pounds, and lately, having grown so fast, he found it hard to do almost anything with his arms and legs. His pants were too short, and his sneakers were the size of casserole pans. He had beautiful, shining, shoulder-length hair and the baby face he\u2019d had all his life."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was Friday, and I asked whether they were done riding around. No one answered. \u201cI have to decorate those,\u201d I said to Brendan. \u201cYou two can help.\u201d He glanced at Rachel, then at me. I looked back at her. I\u2019d figured that those streaks at the corners of her eyes were from the cold, but on closer examination it seemed she\u2019d been crying, or was still crying. She looked at her phone, her hands pink from the cold, and on the screen I saw the bright, anxious face of Kendra. Under Kendra, in a smaller box, was the less bright, less stable Maggie, in a bathrobe."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maggie said, \u201cI\u2019m insecure about my grades.

She\u2019d been a child gymnast, competing around the mid-Atlantic, and every inch of her body had been scrutinized for how it looked and how it moved. The girls on the team had been vicious, so she\u2019d got used to the insults and laughed them off, but she also always cried."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cLily thinks she\u2019s perfect,\u201d Brendan said. \u201cPeople tell her she\u2019s hot.\u201d He tapped his temple. \u201cIt gets to the head.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cGoes to her head,\u201d I said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Rachel cried on the floor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When they were little, Lily had told her that witches lived in tree stumps, and the tooth fairy was your parents. Time had passed since then, but still. She lived two blocks away, and drank all our milk. On nights when Lily slept over, she and Rachel wore each other\u2019s T-shirts, and lay in bed eating from the same container, watching a movie on the same phone. They had a way of cycling through phases\u2014hugging, cuddling, and humping each other, then insulting and attacking. They\u2019d been friends since pre-K, and I assumed this pattern of abuse would go on forever."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I nudged Rachel with my shoe, signalling with my eyes that Lily was an idiot, and she signalled back that she would never recover, and when she didn\u2019t get up off the floor I kicked her."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She stood up and sat next to Brendan, gazing at the decorating stuff with a look of despair that washed over me. She wiped her face. They used the green icing on trees and put silver dots on them. They went on Lily\u2019s Instagram and made fun of a comment she\u2019d written to a boy on Brendan\u2019s basketball team, and laughed at a photo of her sticking out her ass, and at how his teammates referred to her as \u201cthe Predator,\u201d talking like I wasn\u2019t there, or was deaf, or dead. They used chocolate kisses to make tits on snowmen, and sprinkles to make bikinis. There was a second batch baking in the oven."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I ate the test cookie and looked out the window. The sky had cleared. I felt a quiet, steady glow come over me. I was grateful and sensitive to everything."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I liked our neighborhood. I liked or even loved many of my neighbors, and had become closer to them during the pandemic, on the many Saturday nights we\u2019d spent choking on smoke around a bonfire, freezing or in the humidity and mosquitoes, half hysterical after getting sick or getting fired. I knew about these families\u2019 window treatments and pancreatic tumors, their career sorrows and bathroom potpourri, their childhood traumas and prosthetic testicles. I knew whose bedroom light burned in the middle of the night, whose sink disposal jammed and how to fix it, who had died at ninety-four and been found fully clothed on top of his blankets, and how long he\u2019d been there. His name was Herman Grunst. He hadn\u2019t looked a day over eighty-five. I\u2019d seen newspapers piling up outside his house, and should\u2019ve gone over to check on him. Someone else finally did. We all helped one another when a car battery died, or when someone needed to borrow the wet vac after a basement had flooded and rugs and furniture were piled up in the front yard. We came out of our houses with good or terrible news, holding it like a baby, and flung it at whoever was there."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Last Halloween, two doors down, a law librarian named Patty had lain in a cardboard coffin on her porch, dressed as Dracula, and jump-scared even the two-year-old next door, who leaped about ten feet into her brother\u2019s arms. A guy named Scott, who used to live across the street, had been seeing hookers for seventeen years, when he fell in love with his deputy at the Department of Commerce. His wife, Jenny, found their e-mails, and threw him out; she threw him out more than once, actually, loudly enough for some of us to piece together what had happened. Now Scott lived alone, in a studio half a mile away, and was doing all kinds of psychotherapy, while hiding his pension and threatening his ex. His kids had stopped speaking to him, and Jenny had become isolated and nocturnal."}, {"role": "body", "text": "From the kitchen window, I watched my neighbor Ruth walk down her back steps in the yard behind mine. She and her husband, Terry, were hosting the cookie party this year. They had a screened-in gazebo, and a slate patio with a stone fire pit that had seen regular use during the pandemic. Their back door opened, and Terry came out."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He was two years younger than me, fair-haired, left-handed, half Jewish, from the Midwest, and calm\u2014though he and Ruth had fights and threw plates, but that was some insanity they brought out in each other. Terry and I were close. The rain from my gutters poured into his basement. The same woodpecker attacked the soffits on both of our houses. He and I ran together at the track sometimes or played tennis, and he\u2019d go apeshit on the court, beat the crap out of me, then feel bad. Once, we were carrying a couch into his basement and I forgot to close the door and his son, Theo, fell down the stairs. Another time, Rachel barfed all over the inside of his new car. He had this belted leather jacket he\u2019d bought in Italy that made him look like some kind of sleazy dentist. He\u2019d catch me in the yard with the dog at, like, 6 a.m. and yell out the window, \u201cWho do I have to beat up to get socks like that?\u201d He wrote terrible rhyming poems for his kids\u2019 birthdays. He\u2019d solemnly mention Theo\u2019s passion for Mars, or Daphne, the volleyball ace who might become a doctor, his voice turning reedy and sombre, as if he were some ancient forebear squinting into the stars to discern patterns in the growing season."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But there was this fog of feeling around him now that exhausted me, and as I watched him I started to fall apart."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFive more days of school,\u201d Brendan said to Rachel. \u201cThen two weeks off.\u201d He mentioned plans for ice skating and paintball."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Terry started to move a patio chaise, and Ruth turned as he sank down and sort of sat on the ground, then fell backward into the azaleas, so that only one gray ankle boot stuck out from the bushes. Donna Boyle came out of Ruth and Terry\u2019s back door in brightly colored running gear and went down the steps. A flowerpot fell off the deck and smashed. What the hell."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ruth took her husband\u2019s hand and tried to pull him up, but he was too heavy. Donna went back into the house. Ruth\u2019s brother, Kyle, was there, too, staring like a moron through the back door. Somewhere my cell phone rang. I had to get the rest of the cookies out of the oven and put in dinner, a chicken thing with red wine and pearl onions I\u2019d made a thousand times. Someone knocked on my front door.

I grabbed the spoon and went out."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Past Karen Ziti\u2019s house, around the side of Ruth and Terry\u2019s, I breathed slowly to calm myself. I\u2019d spent the pandemic trying to avoid getting sick and dying, trying not to think about the millions who were suffering or dead. I\u2019d worked hard to block out what was happening, and I was good at it. Donna was not as good at it, because she had to deal with things like breast cancer, which she\u2019d told me about one morning before the lockdown, blurted it out by the recycling cans, trembling as she told me. I hugged her, could feel the heat coming off her as I held her. She got chemo and radiation that blew out her immune system, and I forgot about it. Then last year, in the fall, during the peak of the pandemic, her dad died of covid. She had to drive out to the Maryland boonies to pick up her parents\u2019 mail while her mom was in mourning in Florida. She had to fill in their absentee ballots, both parents\u2019, for Trump, even though she hated that fucker and her dad was dead. The mom said it had been his dying wish."}, {"role": "body", "text": "From the moment Terry had told me, I\u2019d understood what was happening. I knew about the disease, and how it went. My dad\u2019s little brother, my uncle Les, he\u2019d had it, and I remember coming home from college and losing a grip on him as he fell to the ground beside my father\u2019s car, telling him I was sorry over and over as his kids looked on, aghast. He and his wife had moved across the state to be closer to my parents, and I remember wheeling him around a grocery store, almost forgetting that he was there. It was like something from a horror movie, except that it was actually from real life. With Terry, I\u2019d developed a plan for enduring the weeks and months and whatever lay ahead. I would rally around him, acting calm and joyful and full of hope. I\u2019d get excited for new research or a drug trial, then days or weeks would pass while I walked the dog the other way to keep from going by his house. At the cookie party, for instance, I could ignore his illness by counting the hours until the end of the night\u2014four hours, give or take, that was easy enough."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At the gate, I heard voices and froze, trying to think of something to say. Then I was on the other side of the gate, beside Kyle. It was getting dark and the fairy lights had come on. I saw the lit-up tree in Alan\u2019s living room, one house over, Alan at the sink, and there things looked plausible and real. When I saw Terry on the ground, I wanted to burst into tears and run away, but my personality functioned like a system of gears and wires. Ruth and Donna wore expressions of concern, standing over his long, broad, bent body. They looked like lawyers, and were both, in fact, lawyers who defended whistle-blowers and knew each other professionally.

She noticed a white disposable mask dangling from her hand, with lipstick all over the inside. Calm down, she thought. That\u2019s my lipstick.
