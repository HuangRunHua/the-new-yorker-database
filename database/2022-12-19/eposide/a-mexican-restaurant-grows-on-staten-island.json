It came in a cartoonishly large beer stein, a volume three times what I\u2019d expected and way more than I could drink\u2014or so I thought. I\u2019d also ordered a Molcajete 5 Carnes, a dish of sizzling meats (including a warmly spiced chorizo patty and a filet of steak pounded thin, fatty edges glistening), vegetables (silky whole green onions, tender spears of charred nopal, or cactus), and grilled quesillo (Oaxaca-style cheese), fetchingly fanned in a mortar carved from volcanic rock. For salsa, I\u2019d opted for the rojo (red); \u201cPica,\u201d the server warned. Muy, muy pica, as it turned out, picantisimo, even, as its kick came from chile de \u00e1rbol, which is usually about five times hotter than a jalape\u00f1o.

These dishes, Marquez-Sanchez explained, help differentiate the restaurant from the deli, but also, she said, \u201cWe\u2019ve tried a lot of Tex-Mex food from other places, like Chevys or even Applebee\u2019s.
