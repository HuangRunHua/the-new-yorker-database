Key security, privacy, and trust and safety executives have also left the company since Musk took over."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMusk\u2019s takeover of Twitter is nothing less than apocalyptic for our communities,\u201d said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Dalit civil rights organization Equality Labs. \u201cThis is not about hurt feelings. This is about direct calls to violence.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Soundararajan took part in a press call on Monday in which representatives from a number of advocacy groups spoke out, insisting that reinstating the accounts of known inciters of violence would pose a threat to human rights worldwide. The speakers highlighted how Musk\u2019s decision would have an outsize impact on regions of the world outside the U.S., where Twitter has either been integral to the safety and security of vulnerable populations or has contributed to political and social unrest."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cFor those of us in the global majority, our Twitter experience does not look anything like that of users in the United States,\u201d said Rosemary Ajayi, lead researcher at Digital Africa Research Lab. \u201cIn Nigeria\u2026we have bad actors, including those engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior, and others evading suspension who have been repeatedly verified even after their accounts have been flagged to Twitter.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The activists\u2019 fears aren\u2019t unfounded, according to a study conducted by researchers at Tufts University\u2019s Digital Planet group, which tracked hate speech on Twitter before and after Musk took over. The analysis found that, in the weeks following Musk\u2019s takeover, hateful tweets became much more prominent among the most popular tweets with potentially toxic language: Seven of the top 20 tweets, including keywords that could indicate anti-LGBTQ+ or antisemitic intent and one of the most popular 20 associated with racist language, were judged to be hateful. Prior to Musk\u2019s takeover, just one tweet out of the three top 20 lists was deemed to be hate speech."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Musk shared his \u201camnesty\u201d decision on Twitter last week after taking a poll on the platform in which over 72% of users who responded voted in favor of reinstating suspended users who \u201chave not broken the law or engaged in egregious spam.\u201d Some 3.1 million users took part in the vote, according to Twitter. The Associated Press has reported that Twitter polls, which Musk also employed in the process of restoring former President Donald Trump\u2019s account, are unscientific and susceptible to the influence of bots."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In India, where Twitter\u2019s role as one of the few remaining forums for relatively free speech is hanging in the balance, Soundararajan said that, prior to Musk\u2019s takeover, there was a consensus at Twitter that a \u201cgenocidal process\u201d aimed at Muslims was occurring in the country."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe have an American company that is operating in a genocidal market without any oversight and that is enabling dangerous speech in an incredibly accelerated way because they\u2019ve basically taken out all of the moderation that was preventing even more copious hate speech,\u201d she said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In early November, Musk tweeted that he would not make any major decisions about content or reinstating banned accounts before convening a \u201ccontent moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints.\u201d However, he later backtracked on that pledge, claiming that the content moderation council was a condition of what Musk said was a now broken deal with \u201ca large coalition\u201d of activist groups that threatened to \u201ckill Twitter\u201d by choking off ad revenue."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now, advocates fear the situation will continue to deteriorate. \u201cWithout a comprehensive tool to deal with violence on this platform, this is only going to get worse,\u201d said Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez, co-CEO of media advocacy organization Free Press."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Twitter did not respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment."}]}
