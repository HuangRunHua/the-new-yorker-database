Tech companies say their wearables and apps that study your body as you snooze can help you get a better night\u2019s rest.

So one of the most common pieces of advice you\u2019ll read about getting better sleep, including in sleep-tracking apps, is to stop using tech a few hours before bedtime."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So why are we adding more tech to our sleep routine?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The latest attempt to solve the problem of sleep comes from Amazon. Last week, the company began selling the $140 Halo Rise, a ring-shaped alarm clock with a built-in sleep tracker. It uses motion sensors to study your movement and breathing patterns to assess your sleep. To wake you up, the device includes a light that can be programmed to gradually get brighter."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With hopes of solving my own sleep problems, I have been testing sleep-tracking technology for several years, including products made by Fitbit and Oura and apps available for the Apple Watch. I have repeatedly felt let down because the data gathered from the devices simply confirmed that I had poor rest, and at times made me feel even more anxious about that."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Still, I was curious to sleep alongside the Halo Rise for a few nights to see what it would offer. Yet again I was disappointed: It provided data with questionable accuracy, and even though I liked being woken up by the yellow light, the same result could be achieved with a light bulb plugged into a timer. Plus, the benefits weren\u2019t strong enough to warrant giving even more of my data to Amazon."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/11/30/multimedia/30techfix-2-fe46/30techfix-2-fe46-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp", "imageWidth": 2048, "imageHeight": 1536, "imageDescription": "The app shows a chart illustrating your sleep stages, including light sleep, deep sleep and R.E.M.

For four sleep sessions, during which I didn\u2019t feel that I slept particularly well, the Halo app graded my sleep \u201cGood.\u201d On each of these nights, my Labrador, a dog in her senior years with special needs, woke me up at an odd hour to go outside."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Monday night was especially problematic. I went to bed at 10:30 and tossed and turned, occasionally looking at the clock, for at least three hours before finally falling asleep.

Dr. Michael Miyamoto, a medical director for Amazon, said the company had done internal studies comparing the results of its algorithms with data measured with polysomnography, the gold standard of sleep tracking that involves hooking up sensors to someone\u2019s face and neck to measure eye movements and brain activity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dr. Miyamoto said that Amazon found the Halo Rise results to be accurate, but that the company had yet to work with a third party to validate the accuracy of the product, though it plans to."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Other consumer-grade sleep trackers are worn on the body or stuffed under the mattress, and research about their accuracy has begun to surface. In March, a study published in Nature and Science of Sleep compared the performance of four commercial sleep trackers, including a Fitbit bracelet and an Oura ring, against gold-standard scientific equipment. The study found that the commercial devices were more accurate at detecting when people were asleep than when they were awake, and concluded that they were not ideal for monitoring different sleep stages."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Olivia Walch, a mathematician who has studied circadian rhythms, said that because research had shown that sleep-tracking wearables had trouble distinguishing sleep from wakefulness, it would probably be even harder for motion sensors to do the job."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What\u2019s more, she called the idea of Amazon\u2019s giving your sleep a grade based on sleep stages \u201cgoofy.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cYou can\u2019t go to bed and say, \u2018I\u2019m going to R.E.M. so hard,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Walch, who leads Arcascope, a tech company that makes an app to help shift workers adjust their body\u2019s internal clock. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be making people feel bad for something that\u2019s outside of their control.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gimmicks and questionable accuracy aside, sleep tech isn\u2019t all bad.
