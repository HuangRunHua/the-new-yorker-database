They might not like having to go out and about when it\u2019s cold outside.

That includes the year-round stuff\u2014getting enough sleep and exercise, and going easy on the alcohol\u2014as well as activities that really lift you up.

There\u2019s so much focus on togetherness during the holidays that those who don\u2019t have a packed calendar might feel isolated and sad. Be open about it. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to say to someone, \u2018I\u2019m alone. What are your plans? I don\u2019t have any yet,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Sue Varma, a psychiatrist in New York. Many people will respond by extending an invitation; perhaps the only reason they hadn\u2019t done so already was that they didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d be available or interested."}, {"role": "body", "text": "You can also seek out new friends and things to do via platforms like Meetup and Nextdoor, Varma recommends. Another way to surround yourself with people is to volunteer, even if it\u2019s not something you plan on doing the rest of the year. Sign up to visit residents at a local nursing home, bake cookies for first-responders, adopt a kitten, or serve food at a homeless shelter.

Setting boundaries is key, Varma says: Tell your mom that you\u2019ll join her for Thanksgiving, but only one-on-one and not with her new husband you don\u2019t get along with. Or, if you don\u2019t have the capacity to deal with your uncle\u2019s political opinions, let your family know you\u2019ll see him in a large group setting (not seated right next to you at dinner)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Have some lines ready to shut down any unwanted conversations.

Ask if you can call them any time you need an ear. Then, you\u2019ll know you have someone to turn to who won\u2019t simply tell you to be merry and have another cookie."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It can also be helpful to find ways of honoring the person\u2014or people\u2014you\u2019re mourning.

As Varma points out, people love to get homemade treats or other inexpensive but thoughtful offerings\u2014\u201csomething as simple as homemade pesto,\u201d she says.
