All of that, plus I would get paid? To travel? Just like that, my future was set. By the time I graduated from college and was headed to TWA flight attendant training in Kansas City, I had already racked up miles in the sky by spending school breaks in Bermuda, the Bahamas, Hawaii, the Virgin Islands and Brazil. I studied TWA\u2019s vast route schedule, planning trips to every city the airline flew to. Once I learned how to successfully evacuate all seven of their aircraft types, carve a first-class chateaubriand, do a safety demonstration in an airplane aisle and correctly apply makeup, I earned my wings and unlimited free passes\u2014my tickets to the great big world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Visits back home to Rhode Island were few as I spent weekends in San Juan and London, visited the Pyramids and the Acropolis, ate spaghetti carbonara in Rome and tiny clams in Lisbon. But as Christmas neared, home was the only place I wanted to be. I grew up in a big Italian-American family. That means the Feast of the Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve and midnight mass; relatives and friends crowding into the house for lasagna and escarole soup on Christmas Day; my father\u2019s famous punch and fudge and peanut brittle. I was 23 years old and had never missed a holiday with my family."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://images.wsj.net/im-675318/?width=639&size=0.6666666666666666", "imageWidth": 639, "imageHeight": 959, "imageDescription": "Ann Hood, author of the new book, \u2018Fly Girl: A Memoir,\u2019 as a TWA flight attendant in the 1980s."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But that year, a snowstorm delayed my return flight from Rome to John F. Kennedy Airport and it looked like I might not make it home. Chances were the flight would be canceled and I\u2019d spend Christmas eating with strangers in a trattoria 4,000 miles from home. I realized then that the only time I don\u2019t like to travel is during the holidays. Not because planes, trains and roads are crowded, or that travel can be more expensive during holiday seasons, but because even though trips have taken me away from my family for months at a time, all I want to do for the holidays is to be at home in Rhode Island."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That snowy December Christmas Eve, the 747 did finally take off. But by the time we landed at JFK, I\u2019d missed all the flights to Providence. I stood in the busy airport and called Amtrak from a pay phone. After I\u2019d been holding for what seemed like forever, the reservationist came on the line to tell me that the last train from Penn Station to Providence had already left. I pictured my family dipping the crystal cups into the matching punchbowl, drinking the Hawaiian Punch and rum with sherbet and strawberries. When I closed my eyes to hold back tears, I could practically smell the dates wrapped in bacon being pulled from the oven, the trays of Italian cookies lined up on the counter, all mingling with my father\u2019s Old Spice and my mother\u2019s Chloe perfume in the air."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I had to get home.

I pulled out of the parking garage and into a heavy blizzard, thick flakes of snow falling hard and fast, covering the windshield. Slowly, I made my way along Route 95 North, through Connecticut. When the large blue- and-white sign that said, \u201cWelcome to Rhode Island, The Ocean State,\u201d appeared through the snow, I beeped my horn like mad. Home was just 20 minutes away."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the next 48 hours, I had no thoughts of foreign cities.

Most of the people who cheered when I walked in that door that long ago snowy night are gone\u2014my parents and brother, my aunts and uncles. That\u2019s why I do it, isn\u2019t it? To hold the people we have close, while we have them? To be hugged and hug them back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I make the punch now, in that same crystal punchbowl, and my kids are the ones hurrying to get home. But I still keep my bags packed.
