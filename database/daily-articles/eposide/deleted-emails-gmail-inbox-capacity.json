The emails contained none of the humor or playfulness of the early Gmail ethos. Instead, they were terse and vaguely threatening, seeming to channel the depressing spirit of financial collapse and austerity present everywhere around us. The subject line: \u201cYour Gmail is almost out of storage.\u201d The body, in essence: This is a shakedown\u2014pay us a subscription fee in perpetuity, and we will continue granting you what we once promised would be free access to your own life and memories."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The message wouldn\u2019t have triggered such resistance had I not been receiving it from every other quarter of my digital life simultaneously\u2014if Apple hadn\u2019t already ransacked my pockets for subscription fees to maintain my ever-expanding photo archive, and to insure and finance \u201ccare\u201d for my ever more expensive assortment of its products; if Microsoft hadn\u2019t insisted that I subscribe to its word-processing software; if so many talented, enterprising friends and acquaintances didn\u2019t now depend on Substack and Patreon donations; if I didn\u2019t have to rent my music library from Spotify instead of owning my own records; if I didn\u2019t have to fork over Prime fees to Amazon for my packages and to watch professional tennis; if I hadn\u2019t been obliged to maintain Netflix, Canal+, and AppleTV accounts so that my children would sit quietly on airplanes; if Elon Musk hadn\u2019t promised to render my tweets invisible if I didn\u2019t pay him in monthly $8 installments. By the time those damn Gmail requests became unignorable, I had long since reached the point of peak micropayments. I was drowning in subscriptions."}, {"role": "body", "text": "So I became determined to delete thousands of deadweight messages. It seemed a straightforward task. One morning, I made coffee, put on a podcast, and started emptying my drafts folder in Gmail, then the Promotions tab, then the Social tab. Processing so many messages takes time. Once I reached my inbox, I kept clicking and clicking, searching for entire categories of email that I could move in bulk to the trash folder. Then the phone rang, and my concentration shifted. I don\u2019t know what happened exactly, but when I hung up, I saw that I\u2019d freed up more than 13 of my 15 available gigabytes of storage. A sense of panic set in as I realized I\u2019d erased the entirety of my inbox."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Three months after graduating from college, I moved from my parents\u2019 home in New Jersey to the rainy postindustrial city of Lille, 30 minutes from the Belgian border. That was September 2003, and I now struggle to access the mental and emotional terrain of that seemingly recent but qualitatively alien technological era. At the time, I owned a Motorola Razr and a Compaq laptop. Although I\u2019d enjoyed and profited from\u2014primarily in the form of free music downloads\u2014the convenience of a high-speed Ethernet connection as a student, it didn\u2019t even occur to me to set up Wi-Fi in my minuscule studio. Once or twice a week, I visited the cybercafe around the corner to read and respond to emails."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I\u2019d decided to move to France to be closer to a girl, but she had broken up with me over the summer\u2014and, for better and worse, I was about to learn what being lonely really meant. I spent those early months either in that tiny studio, brewing stovetop coffee and playing the MP3s I\u2019d downloaded, or whittling away the entirety of my ridiculously modest salary in caf\u00e9s, feeling warm inside while watching the rain streak down the windows. Those were what Junot D\u00edaz called \u201cthe discovery years,\u201d and I roamed the city high on life and consumed by daydreams. In the midst of tremendous boredom, I felt the bursts of epiphany that I realize now are the true wealth of the young and inexperienced. And I wrote down everything I was thinking and feeling, in long and detailed emails addressed to my best friend from college, who had moved to Russia, and to my mother\u2014and they, in turn, sent me wonderfully detailed responses."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Many of these exchanges achieved the sentimental weight of paper letters and contained a concentration of inspired observation and raw yearning that I have seldom felt able to equal even in published writing. Yet they were housed precariously on Yahoo and Hotmail servers. By the time I moved to Manhattan the following year to buy myself some time as I figured out what to do next, Gmail was the hot ticket. Soon enough, all of that tortured, ecstatic testimony and empathetic witness ended up in the same digital cemetery that hosts decayed Napster files and whole iPhoto archives no longer compatible with upgraded operating systems. I mourned their loss, but I was young or ignorant enough to believe that my most important memories and conversations would always be ahead of me. In any event, I wasn\u2019t thinking about loss in 2004, when my colleague Daria blessed me with a coveted Gmail invite. \u201cHow does it feel to be a G now?\u201d she wrote."}, {"role": "body", "text": "From that moment on, Gmail became my central means of communication. It felt like an act of extraordinary altruism\u2014a much-improved user experience, ostensibly with storage limits but ones that, like the horizon, miraculously retreated as you approached them. I continued to write and receive long digital letters, but the pace of exchange was quickening. The messages grew shorter, more dashed off, and far more numerous. Gmail itself was a destination, and the chat function stayed open on my desktop throughout the workday. My friends and I started our first chains, some of which stretch into the present. Soon, we also adopted the habit of tapping out text messages on cellphones and writing on one another\u2019s walls on Myspace and Facebook."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By 2007, when the iPhone dropped, the internet and constant connectivity had rendered my previous relationship with technology and pace of correspondence almost unrecognizable. Email was no longer my only or even primary means of keeping in touch with loved ones and confidants, and lengthy declarations grew more sporadic. But I still composed, with great thought and care, heartfelt paragraphs about serious disputes or misunderstandings or romantic ruminations. My Gmail inbox contained the majority of my most sincere reflections and declarations."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When I started writing for a living rather than for amusement, my Gmail account (along with the Notes app) also displaced the paper notebooks I used to fill with snippets of insight and self-directed messages and prompts for the future. I would save manuscripts and works in progress by forwarding myself the Word documents. My Gmail inbox became an archive of not just my personal travails but also my professional efforts and gradual achievements. Every single romantic relationship I lived through as an adult began and ended\u2014and was narrated and dissected\u2014in maddening threads of Gmail correspondence. The jubilant record of my courtship and marriage; the heartbreaking arguments and hard-won reconciliations; the polyphonic story of my bachelor party and those of my groomsmen; the joy of my children\u2019s birth, with photos appended\u2014it all crowded up with records of travel, receipts, spam, meaningless banter, many thousands of redundant messages notifying me of Twitter and Facebook notifications. This was my inbox: as unique as a snowflake, some two decades in the making and amounting to 90,000 messages\u2014and it is gone now."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That morning, my mind spun as I tried in vain to re-create the various perceptions and emotions that had been written into Google\u2019s servers and were now abandoned to the ether. I felt a sudden sense of mourning that I still have not gotten over. And yet, to my surprise, I felt something else alongside it: a conflicting sense of relief and even levity. I would never have voluntarily deleted all of those emails, but I also can\u2019t deny, not entirely, that there is something cathartic about sloughing off those thousands of accumulated disappointments and rebukes, those passionate and pathetic fights and dramas, even those insights and stirrings\u2014all of those complicated yet ephemeral layers of former selves that no longer contain me. I began to accept that I would need to imagine my way back into those previous mental states if they were truly worth revisiting\u2014and that if I could not, then the loss was necessarily manageable. I closed my laptop, wandered outside into the specific corner of France that my former selves\u2019 cumulative choices had led me to inhabit, and was overtaken by a sense of hope."}]}
