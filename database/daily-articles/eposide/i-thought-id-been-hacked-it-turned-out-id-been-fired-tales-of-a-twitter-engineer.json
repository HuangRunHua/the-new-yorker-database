Some of us had worked through the weekend trying to help out a colleague who\u2019d been given an insanely tight deadline to transform Twitter\u2019s verification process: Elon Musk had just announced that he wanted to make the coveted blue tick available to anyone willing to pay for a premium service."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When you\u2019re building any new system, you have to make sure it works consistently for hundreds of millions of users. You have to code solutions for every variable you can imagine \u2013 a surge in requests at a particular time of day, a brief loss of connection with the payment-processing company. My colleague, whom I liked a lot, was never going to get it done in time without help, so we all pitched in. I actually quite enjoyed it. I wasn\u2019t really thinking about whether those changes were good for Twitter; I just really liked being part of that community, working together on a deadline. I even slept on a sofa in the office on Saturday night."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "My boss was fired. So was his boss. And his boss\u2019s boss.

About 15 minutes into the conversation my video stopped: I\u2019d been signed out of my work email. I tried to log back in, but a message flashed up saying that my password had just been changed. Then my laptop screen turned grey. I wondered if I\u2019d been hacked \u2013 I\u2019d received a text message from corporate security during the meeting saying that they needed to speak to me urgently."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://github.com/HuangRunHua/the-new-yorker-database/raw/main/database/images/9.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280, "imageHeight": 853}, {"role": "body", "text": "I never found out what they wanted: a few minutes later my boss\u2019s boss called me to tell me I was fired, with immediate effect. As far as I know I was the first Twitter engineer this happened to. Musk has sacked about half the workforce since then. My boss was fired. So was his boss. And his boss\u2019s boss. And their boss."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Software engineers can be quite entitled. These days you can make a six-figure salary in your first job out of university. Even now, with all the layoffs, if you say on LinkedIn that you\u2019re a software engineer open to offers you\u2019ll get ten messages a day from headhunters. Companies try to retain people with perks like free lunch, and people obsess about which ones are best."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "We were told to \u201ctune out the noise\u201d, but that was hard when the TV blared out the latest rumours every morning"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The technical screening process for these jobs is quite rigorous. Most employers make you do a coding exercise, which is a bit like a maths exam. Lots of people dread them, but I sometimes do a company\u2019s test even if I have no intention of taking up a job there. I find writing code stimulating. \u200b\u200bMy computer screen looks like something you\u2019d see in a corny movie about hackers: a black background with blinking lines of text running all the way down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "My first engineering job was at Google, where I worked for 14 years. I wanted to work there because the company seemed to value something other than chasing profits.

It collaborated with the Pentagon and US Customs and Border Protection. I like to draw, and I vented some of my frustration by publishing satirical cartoons about the culture at Google, but by 2021 I was ready for a change. Twitter was the only other big tech company that seemed to have some ethical values, so I was pleased to get a job there. I worked mainly on the web interface, trying to speed up the user experience by finding ways to shave off half a second of friction in different places."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At Google the senior leaders got very good at dodging questions. Twitter was smaller and younger, and you could ask the management direct questions at town-hall meetings. I liked the chief executive, Parag Agrawal, who had an engineering background: corporate doublespeak doesn\u2019t come naturally to engineers. Twitter snacks weren\u2019t quite as enticing as Google\u2019s (chocolate-covered almonds rather than M&Ms), but it felt like a more honest place."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "You can design your own emojis on Slack: someone quickly came up with one for Musk"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Musk takeover rumours started in March. There was talk of him taking the company private, and laying off three-quarters of staff. The town-hall sessions became awkward.

The chief executive told us to \u201ctune out the noise\u201d, but that was hard when the TV blared out the latest rumours every morning. Details of our internal meetings started to be leaked to journalists, which made the leadership less forthcoming, which in turn made employees leak even more information to journalists because they were so frustrated. We became experts at reading between the lines: we knew the takeover talk was serious when the chief executive began to sprinkle his sentences with the word \u201cfiduciary\u201d."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://github.com/HuangRunHua/the-new-yorker-database/raw/main/database/images/11.jpg", "imageWidth": 1280, "imageHeight": 853}, {"role": "body", "text": "In June, Hurricane Musk himself appeared at a town hall.

We had to be careful: the possibility of a legal suit between Musk and Twitter meant that these messages could end up in court, so we relied heavily on emojis. You can design your own emojis on Slack, and someone quickly came up with one for Musk. I produced one with the chief executive\u2019s face that said \u201cfiduciary\u201d. That got used a lot, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In late October Musk turned up in the Twitter offices with a sink, telling people: \u201cLet that sink in!\u201d At the time I thought it was quite funny. Here was the richest man in the world, who probably earns in seconds what I make in a month. Yet he\u2019d taken the time and effort to get hold of a sink \u2013 or at least to make an assistant get hold of a sink \u2013 to carry into the Twitter office, just for the sake of a silly pun."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "We were too busy to think about the strategy.

It\u2019s hard to pay attention to the red flags when your salary depends on ignoring them. No one wanted to be confrontational. Some of the early changes he wanted were good.

As soon as Musk actually took over, there were always three things that had to be done by yesterday."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Musk made people nervous. People started to think about what they would do if they were sacked. I was never interested in joining a union before all this happened \u2013 I felt like a spoiled brat, given all the perks and stock options we enjoyed. But collective action seems important now. One day I created a tool that made it faster to download things from your work email that you might need if you were looking for a job: performance evaluations and that sort of thing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I posted the tool on Slack so that my colleagues could also benefit from it if they needed to.
