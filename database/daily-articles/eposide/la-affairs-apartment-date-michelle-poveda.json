I moved there from Chino, my hometown, to attend San Diego State University, and I spent many years as an executive assistant in higher education. Over the years, most of my closest friends relocated to L.A., and life in San Diego became a lot lonelier. Between 2016 and 2018, I lost my father to Alzheimer\u2019s, a boyfriend to drug addiction, and my confidence and enthusiasm for meeting anyone new and trustworthy.

But which L.A. neighborhood would I call home?

While at her place, I was chatting with Antonio on the dating app Hinge. He was of Brazilian descent, tall, dark and handsome, and he was a professor from Mid-Wilshire who was very charming via text. As the daughter of Ecuadorian immigrants, I was excited to meet a fellow South American."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Growing up Latina in Southern California but not of Mexican descent has always made me feel like an outsider. Living biculturally comes with many unique challenges, such as translating documents for your parents while trying to complete your Shakespeare homework and explaining to your parents what prom is and why it\u2019s important. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there\u2019s that extra feeling of not belonging to a specific culture or place (for example, telling my Mexican American college roommate that I grew up eating pan instead of tortillas and aj\u00ed instead of salsa verde).

It took me at least 15 minutes to figure out how to enter the complex itself, and then I drove around trying to find which building Antonio was in. I finally found him. He wore a flowing, button-up shirt perfect for the warm July night, and he had a giant smile on his face. He guided me where to park in that beast of a parking lot, and then we were on our way to the Grove."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Although a native Angeleno, Antonio didn\u2019t realize that the Farmers Market next to the Grove closes early.

I think you\u2019ll like it,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As we waited to get out of the Farmers Market parking lot, there was an idled black BMW in front of us blocking the exit.

Instead of giving a light tap on his car horn, Antonio put his Jeep in park, jumped out of the driver\u2019s seat and walked up to the driver\u2019s side of the car. "}, {"role": "body", "text": "I should mention that Antonio was a little over 6 feet tall, with a muscular build and shaved head, and he had a bravado about him that would make anyone nervous, especially if he stood outside someone's driver's side window at night."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The BMW sped off, and Antonio hopped back in the Jeep."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhat happened?

While looking for parking, I noticed how nice some of the apartment complexes on Hawthorn Avenue were. I saw twinkling lights hanging from a balcony and giant blue and gold flags waving in the light summer breeze that announced \"for rent\" possibilities for buildings not normally known to have vacancies. I could smell jasmine in the air, and I saw the little white flowers bursting from the deep green bushes that adorned the front of the old Hollywood buildings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThis is kind of a cute neighborhood,\u201d I said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Antonio gave a quick glance around and said, \u201cEh, it\u2019s kinda trashy.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Once Antonio made it abundantly clear that he had no interest in spending more on me than you would at a Farmers Market stall, that he was an anti-vaxxer, wasn\u2019t really a professor but a karate instructor and was in between gigs, I called it quits with him \u2014 but not with that neighborhood."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hollywood is a chaotic area, but my charming 1940s apartment with crown molding and wooden floors is walking distance to Bossa Nova.

And it's where my current boyfriend snuggles with me on the couch as we browse Zillow listings for the next place I can call home."}]}
