These leftovers are brought to Sumi courtesy of Catch Steak, the recently opened West Hollywood restaurant that\u2019s more of a home to conventionally beautiful people than it is a fine-dining establishment."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Wagyu beef found comradeship in our fridge perched next to the names of pasta I can barely pronounce and fish flown first-class from Japan that needs to be eaten soon before it passes the human (and shiba inu) consumption date.

She too has become accustomed to eating the finer things in life."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWe'd better hurry,\u201d my girlfriend, the food critic (who doesn't work for The Times), calls as I reach for my father\u2019s vintage gray suede jacket. That 1970s jacket and my Bollywood star looks I credit to him. I am forced to dress up for the third night in a week like a brown Ken doll to my girlfriend\u2019s Asian Barbie. My benefactor is ready and sharply dressed as always. This time it\u2019s red satin (I love red on her)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cTwo for Christine,\u201d says my girlfriend before we\u2019re led to our table at Ardor, the West Hollywood Edition\u2019s lobby restaurant.

I moved to L.A. after meeting her. A crypto company flew me out for a weeklong L.A. trip when we first met. She was contemplating canceling our first date because I didn\u2019t live in L.A. at the time, but her friends said she should give me a chance because I was pretty (thanks again, Dad!). I had been on a dating marathon in Boston, which was going nowhere, so I showed up in fine fighting form to impress her. Sparks flew on our first date, which ended with us aggressively making out by Nancy Silverton\u2019s Osteria Mozza restaurant. There was absolutely the physical attraction but also the prospect that this could be something more."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We continued dating for the rest of my trip, which included a visit to the stunning Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens; a bank-breaking dinner at one of Rihanna\u2019s favorite restaurants, Giorgio Baldi (more celebrity hot spot than good food), located off Pacific Coast Highway; and a night out that ended at Culver City speakeasy Blind Barber (you enter through a barbershop)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "We\u2019ve settled into our relationship now that it\u2019s been over a year. My girlfriend and I don\u2019t live together, but we made sure we found apartments less than a 10-minute drive in traffic from each other. She takes me to fancy dinners all over town, and as a result, I\u2019ve had a tour of L.A.\u2019s dining scene."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cDon\u2019t forget we have our weekend trip to Solvang coming up, and the fridge is already full of leftovers,\u201d my girlfriend says during our meal as I\u2019m sucked back into reality. I am reminded of our dizzying array of to-go boxes crammed in both our fridges like some sort of takeout Tetris, labeled with dish name and date. The situation can get so unmanageable that we had to procure a second fridge for her."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Dinners, especially work dinners, have taken on a very different meaning for us. Couples often mark special occasions, romantic dates or anniversaries at the jet-set restaurants we frequent, but my food critic is on her phone for a decent portion of our meal. She\u2019s most often doing research about the restaurant and what to order, coordinating freelancers or getting her daily doomscrolling in. That leaves me feeling quite alone in a restaurant surrounded by those couples celebrating milestones. I try not to take it to heart, because \u201cIt\u2019s just another work visit,\u201d I\u2019m reminded. Some of the glamour of eating out slightly fades."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not one to back down, I bring this up with my food overlord, and we settle on having a date night every week or two. Our dates take many different shapes and forms. A memorable one was riding the Echo Park swan boats and capping our night with Thai food from Sanamluang Cafe. Other times there may be events that fall outside the scope of her jobs that we attend such as seeing French house duo Polo & Pan at the Hollywood Bowl (where we accidentally took leftovers that belonged to the couple next to us) or a winter music festival in Palm Springs on a tarmac amid World War II aircraft."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I love L.A. and I mostly love being a plus-one and going to all these dinners. Sometimes it makes me feel like a sugar baby, especially me chirping, \u201cThank you, Mommy\u201d at the end of a $200-plus meal. I\u2019ve gotten to see what life really is like in this city, the commotion of Koreatown (with its Korean barbecue, taverns and more), the vibe of every new hotel restaurant in West Hollywood and the feel of cruising on Pacific Coast Highway to drink in the view at Nobu Malibu. L.A. has become the home I\u2019ve always been looking for, and every inch of it is ingrained in my memory with my critic."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I don\u2019t know what the future holds for us. How long can someone keep doing such a demanding job and also try to write a novel? Will we get married in a couple of years? Or realistically, how long can our gastrointestinal tracts take such abuse?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "No matter what, nothing will ever take away my year dating an L.A. food critic and how I fell in love with this wonderful and wacky person, this city and all the chaos in between."}]}
