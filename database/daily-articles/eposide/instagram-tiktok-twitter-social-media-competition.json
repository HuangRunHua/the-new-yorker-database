But now it\u2019s not so surprising at all. To scroll through Instagram today is to parse a series of sponsored posts from brands, recommended Reels from people you don\u2019t follow, and the occasional picture from a friend that\u2019s finally surfaced after being posted several days ago.

In 2014, the app hit 300 million monthly active users, surpassing Twitter for the first time. The Instagram Stories feature, a direct rip-off of Snapchat, was introduced in August 2016 and outpaced the original just one year later. But although Instagram now has 2 billion monthly users, it faces an existential problem: What happens when the 18-to-29-year-olds who are most likely to use the app, at least in America, age out or go elsewhere? Last year, The New York Times reported that Instagram was privately worried about attracting and retaining the new young users that would sustain its long-term growth\u2014not to mention whose growing shopping potential is catnip to advertisers. TikTok is already more popular among young American teens. Plus, a series of algorithm changes\u2014and some questionable attempts to copy features from other apps\u2014have disenchanted many of the users who are sticking around."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Over the summer, these frustrations boiled over. An update that promised, among other things, algorithmically recommended video content that would fill the entire screen was a bridge too far.

Internal documents obtained by The Wall Street Journal show that Instagram users spend 17.6 million hours a day watching Reels, Instagram\u2019s TikTok knockoff, compared with the 197.8 million hours people spend watching TikTok every day. The documents also revealed that Reels engagement has declined by 13.6 percent in recent months, with most users generating \u201cno engagement whatsoever.\u201d When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Instagram said this report referred to a \u201ca moment-in-time snapshot blown out of proportion.\u201d They pointed to Meta\u2019s recent earnings call, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared that Reels plays have seen 50 percent growth in the past six months."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Instagram may not be on its deathbed, but its transformation from cool to cringe is a sea change in the social-media universe. The platform was perhaps the most significant among an old generation of popular apps that embodied the original purpose of social media: to connect online with friends and family. Its decline is about not just a loss of relevance, but a capitulation to a new era of \u201cperformance\u201d media, in which we create online primarily to reach people we don\u2019t know instead of the people we do. That has broader implications for Instagram\u2019s most significant by-product: influencers."}, {"role": "body", "text": "People have found ways to get paid for their content online since long before Instagram existed. But the app certainly led to an aesthetic shift, toward pink background walls and flat-lay photography, and facilitated the rise of the modern content creator. Lavish brand deals, in which an influencer promotes a brand\u2019s product to their audience for a fee, have been known to pay anywhere from $100 to $10,000 per post, depending on the size of the creator\u2019s following and their engagement. Now Tilghman, who became an Instagram influencer in 2015 and at one point had close to 400,000 followers, says she\u2019s seen her rate go down by 80 percent over the past five years.
