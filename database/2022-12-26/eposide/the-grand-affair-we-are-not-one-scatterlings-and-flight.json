As one of the premier portraitists of the Belle \u00c9poque, John Singer Sargent lived a life befitting his status: garnering praise at the Paris Salon, painting such figures as Isabella Stewart Gardner and Teddy Roosevelt, and socializing with luminaries like Henry James and Oscar Wilde. But, as this sensitive biography makes clear, Sargent also pursued less socially acceptable interests; he had an abiding fascination with the male nude and was involved in intimate, somewhat ambiguous relationships with same-sex friends and models. Fisher wisely avoids making sweeping claims about Sargent\u2019s sexuality, choosing instead to examine how \u201cthe protected and sanctioned camaraderie of the studio\u201d enabled the painter\u2019s art and social life to take on quietly unconventional forms."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6397b207c15e2521bb42b91b/master/w_1600,c_limit/221226_r41616web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "We Are Not One, by Eric Alterman (Basic). In this fearless account, Alterman, a journalist and a historian, sets out to describe the complex relationship between Israel and the U.S., at a moment when the former, having just elected the most conservative government in its history, is a distinctly red state, while, in the latter, Jews make up one of the bluest constituencies. He provides a scrupulous history of the crucial debates over Zionism, anti-Zionism, Palestine, the role of memory and the Holocaust, and America\u2019s interactions with Israel. Alterman\u2019s aim is not to flatter readers, no matter their ideological camp, but, rather, to scrutinize mythologies and fairy tales in order to make greater sense of why Israeli and American Jews, particularly in non-Orthodox communities, appear to be drifting farther apart."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6397b205c91dd81850793337/master/w_1600,c_limit/221226_r41617web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Scatterlings, by Re\u0161oket\u0161we Manenzhe (HarperVia). Set in South Africa in 1927, this powerful novel chronicles the unravelling of a biracial family in the wake of the Immorality Act, which outlawed sexual relations between white and Black people. A winemaker of Dutch and English heritage; his wife, who was born to formerly enslaved parents in Jamaica; and their two daughters are \u201ctumbled into chaos\u201d by the new law. In despair, the mother makes a decision that costs two family members their lives; the surviving pair flee the country. Manenzhe situates this tragic tale within the broader context of the displacement and abuse of Africans caused by colonialism and the slave trade, but her achievement is to humanize the victims of that legacy, in a story that feels like an act of restoration."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6397b205aa0ea2fe7e7ebbfc/master/w_1600,c_limit/221226_r41618web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Flight, by Lynn Steger Strong (Mariner). In this compact, minutely observed novel, the fate of a house in Florida\u2014in which the three adult children of a recently deceased woman were raised\u2014becomes the subject of delicate debate. Taking place in the lead-up to the first Christmas after the mother\u2019s death, the story centers on her gathered offspring, their spouses, and their own children, employing a roving perspective to tease out each character\u2019s response to loss and kinship.
