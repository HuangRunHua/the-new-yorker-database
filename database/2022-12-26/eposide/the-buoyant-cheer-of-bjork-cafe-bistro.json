At her newest restaurant, a caf\u00e9 called Bj\u00f6rk, in the lobby of Scandinavia House, a Nordic cultural center in midtown, Bengtsson bounds around the dining room beaming, with a buoyancy that can\u2019t be learned."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A good personality doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into good food, of course, but at Bj\u00f6rk it feels like the secret ingredient. Patrons of Ulrika\u2019s, the homey Upper East Side restaurant that Bengtsson ran from 1999 to 2006 (before that, she cooked at the Swedish consulate and at Aquavit), will be thrilled to reunite with her bisque: Arctic char, salmon, cod, and crunchy cold-water shrimp are nestled with fingerling potato, carrots, and leeks and then bathed tableside in a light, creamy saffron-and-fennel broth. During a recent meal at Bj\u00f6rk, the air became heady with the powerful perfume of bacon, which emerged from the kitchen moments later, paired with lingonberry preserves atop a thin, golden-edged waffle, made from a grated-potato-based batter, that could be broken into heart-shaped quarters."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/639b46371340037393ec5bfb/master/w_1600,c_limit/221226_r41640.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 2000, "imageDescription": "The smorgasbord plate includes meatballs with lingonberry preserves, gravlax in mustard sauce, and \u201cJansson\u2019s temptation,\u201d a casserole of shredded potato and marinated sprats."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/639b463820be7b22b6f185f7/master/w_1600,c_limit/221226_r41641.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 2000, "imageDescription": "The chef, Ulrika Bengtsson, who grew up in the Swedish countryside eating moose hunted by her father and prepared by her mother, presides over the restaurant with a palpable joy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When I tried the same waffle topped with seaweed roe and dairy-free sour cream, I suspected that there had been a mistake; had I been given the whitefish roe and regular sour cream instead? \u201cNo, that\u2019s the seaweed!\u201d Bengtsson said, laughing, as she made her rounds. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d When I inquired about the provenance of the tiny, gently briny orange orbs, indistinguishable from tobiko, she leaned in and mock-whispered, \u201cikea.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d, or open-faced sandwiches, such as one spread with \u201cGentleman\u2019s delight,\u201d a salad of herring and hard-boiled egg, are lovely and light. The open-faced tunnbr\u00f6d, similar to Norwegian lefse, here a pan-fried, mashed-potato-based flatbread, is much heavier, topped with more mashed potato, pickled cucumber, fried onions, mustard, and two charred hot dogs, their ends split open like flower petals.

If that sounds like too much work, Bj\u00f6rk\u2019s rotating menu of dagens (Swedish for \u201cdishes of the day\u201d) provides a potent dose. A seeded roll, with a saucer of dimpled butter balls, precedes a wooden tray holding a cup of black coffee, a tiny mug of sweet-and-sour borscht, a bowl of mixed lettuces dressed lightly in lemon and olive oil, and something wonderful as the centerpiece: on Tuesdays, it\u2019s a neat square of laxpudding, a gratin layered with sliced potato, onion, and gravlax, finished with brown butter and shaved horseradish. The smorgasbord plate is hygge, too, an array of treats including Swedish meatballs, two types of herring, a triangle of Priest XO cheese, and a ramekin of \u201cJansson\u2019s temptation,\u201d a casserole of shredded potato and marinated sprats, sealed with crispy bread crumbs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For dessert, the waffle-maker is employed again: a sweet version made with milk and vanilla is topped with whipped cream and raspberry jam. There are cakes, pastries, and cookies, too, such as kolakakor, a snappy shortbread that tastes of salted caramel, plus, in the gift shop, the next generation of Swedish fish, in flavors like elderflower and sour blueberry and in shapes like turbot and pike. Kolsvart, the brand that makes them, in Malm\u00f6, donates part of the proceeds to promote healthy waters and fish stocks. (Dishes $9-$29.)"}]}
