If there’s a more cheerful person in New York City than the chef Ulrika Bengtsson, who grew up in the Swedish countryside, eating moose hunted by her father and prepared by her mother, I’d like to meet her. “I was born full of energy,” she writes in the surprisingly stirring “About” section of her LinkedIn profile, and I don’t doubt it for a second. At her newest restaurant, a café called Björk, in the lobby of Scandinavia House, a Nordic cultural center in midtown, Bengtsson bounds around the dining room beaming, with a buoyancy that can’t be learned.

A good personality doesn’t necessarily translate into good food, of course, but at Björk it feels like the secret ingredient. Patrons of Ulrika’s, the homey Upper East Side restaurant that Bengtsson ran from 1999 to 2006 (before that, she cooked at the Swedish consulate and at Aquavit), will be thrilled to reunite with her bisque: Arctic char, salmon, cod, and crunchy cold-water shrimp are nestled with fingerling potato, carrots, and leeks and then bathed tableside in a light, creamy saffron-and-fennel broth. During a recent meal at Björk, the air became heady with the powerful perfume of bacon, which emerged from the kitchen moments later, paired with lingonberry preserves atop a thin, golden-edged waffle, made from a grated-potato-based batter, that could be broken into heart-shaped quarters.

When I tried the same waffle topped with seaweed roe and dairy-free sour cream, I suspected that there had been a mistake; had I been given the whitefish roe and regular sour cream instead? “No, that’s the seaweed!” Bengtsson said, laughing, as she made her rounds. “Isn’t it amazing?” When I inquired about the provenance of the tiny, gently briny orange orbs, indistinguishable from tobiko, she leaned in and mock-whispered, “ikea.”

The smørrebrød, or open-faced sandwiches, such as one spread with “Gentleman’s delight,” a salad of herring and hard-boiled egg, are lovely and light. The open-faced tunnbröd, similar to Norwegian lefse, here a pan-fried, mashed-potato-based flatbread, is much heavier, topped with more mashed potato, pickled cucumber, fried onions, mustard, and two charred hot dogs, their ends split open like flower petals. Heartier still is a beautiful plate of tender, fatty brisket, sliced into batons and strewn with bits of roasted carrot, zucchini, and potato and a tangy parsley cream sauce.

In the Scandinavia House gift shop, among miniature-woollen-sweater Christmas-tree ornaments and Pippi Longstocking dolls, there’s a book that purports to teach you how to achieve hygge, the Danish concept of coziness, in your home. If that sounds like too much work, Björk’s rotating menu of dagens (Swedish for “dishes of the day”) provides a potent dose. A seeded roll, with a saucer of dimpled butter balls, precedes a wooden tray holding a cup of black coffee, a tiny mug of sweet-and-sour borscht, a bowl of mixed lettuces dressed lightly in lemon and olive oil, and something wonderful as the centerpiece: on Tuesdays, it’s a neat square of laxpudding, a gratin layered with sliced potato, onion, and gravlax, finished with brown butter and shaved horseradish. The smorgasbord plate is hygge, too, an array of treats including Swedish meatballs, two types of herring, a triangle of Priest XO cheese, and a ramekin of “Jansson’s temptation,” a casserole of shredded potato and marinated sprats, sealed with crispy bread crumbs.

For dessert, the waffle-maker is employed again: a sweet version made with milk and vanilla is topped with whipped cream and raspberry jam. There are cakes, pastries, and cookies, too, such as kolakakor, a snappy shortbread that tastes of salted caramel, plus, in the gift shop, the next generation of Swedish fish, in flavors like elderflower and sour blueberry and in shapes like turbot and pike. Kolsvart, the brand that makes them, in Malmö, donates part of the proceeds to promote healthy waters and fish stocks. (Dishes $9-$29.)
