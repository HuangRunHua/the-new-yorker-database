New York is no California. Still, Brooklyn chimneys toppled and windows shattered in the summer of 1884, when a quake struck near Coney Island: magnitude 5, or thereabouts. (Seismometers were not then in wide circulation.) Anything larger, amid today\u2019s infrastructure, would cause quite a bit of damage. But we have scant records about how frequently such a quake occurs. \u201cEvery thousand years, every ten thousand years, every million years?,\u201d William Menke, a seismologist at Columbia\u2019s Lamont-Doherty observatory, wondered recently, with the potential destruction of the metropolitan region in mind. \u201cIt makes a difference!\u201d Many major earthquakes have occurred on the East Coast, he explained. We just don\u2019t know when."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Menke was hiking up a mountain in Harriman State Park, beside the Ramapo Fault, to try to fill in the gaps. He was in search of rocks whose shape and placement gave him a sense of existential comfort instead of dread. \u201cThat was the one that started me thinking about this,\u201d he said, arriving at a bobsled-size boulder perched near the edge of a shallow cliff. \u201cThat must say something important about the amount of shaking that occurred since it was put up there. If there was a lot of shaking, it would have fallen.\u201d A hiking companion couldn\u2019t resist a futile push. The boulder was deposited there, of course, by a glacier. \u201cEverything here reeks of the Ice Age,\u201d Menke said. The last of the glaciers melted in these parts around fifteen thousand years ago. Auspicious."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The two continued climbing, in search of ever more precariously perched boulders. Some were too small to rule out human intervention. \u201cYou can see somebody moved those hefty rocks into a bench configuration,\u201d Menke noted of one arrangement, near the remains of a campfire. Another boulder, intriguingly top-heavy, sat in a crack, making it harder to dislodge, and therefore unworthy of scrutiny. Menke crouched beside others to sketch their contours in a notebook and measure the slopes of the underlying bedrock, using a carpenter\u2019s level and an inclinometer, for which he\u2019d paid eight dollars at Lowe\u2019s. \u201cMost of the stuff I do is pretty low tech,\u201d he said. \u201cI have occasionally lost things in the field and then found them six months later, a little rusty.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/637eb730e081ee1e4931db8c/master/w_1600,c_limit/221205_a26214.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1384, "imageDescription": "\u201cIt\u2019s made from one hundred per cent dinosaur-based petroleum products.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Menke\u2019s gray hair was untrimmed and, like some of the stones he examined, in seeming defiance of gravity. His fixation on the geology was such that he failed to notice a buck galloping past, though he called attention to a small discoloration in the bedrock at one point. \u201cSee the surface here? Something was protecting this from erosion. Was there a boulder there that rolled off? Where is it?\u201d Using some back-of-the-envelope physics, he estimated the amount of gravitational acceleration required to send various candidates in his notebook sliding downhill. \u201cThe last one we did was on a more gentle slope, and it was about point three of gravity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that would be about a seven-and-a-half magnitude.\u201d By contrast, a giant sea-turtle-shaped rock on a steeper slope seemed likely to ski with a magnitude 7. \u201cSo that, actually, is an interesting number,\u201d Menke said. \u201cIf you can rule out that there have been any earthquakes of magnitude 7 since the end of the Ice Age, that actually is pretty important in terms of New York\u2019s seismic risk.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Proper science would require his following up with sophisticated camera technology, for photogrammetry and 3-D computer modelling. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you a funny story about a Greek dude,\u201d Menke said, referring to the astronomer Aristarchus, who attempted to estimate the distance from the earth to the sun. \u201cHe did a pretty good job, but there was a critical piece of info he needed to know, and that was the angular diameter of the sun. It\u2019s half a degree, and he guessed that it was two degrees. Had he been careful to measure things, he would have gotten the right number.\u201d For now, though, Menke took comfort in what the naked eye was telling him. Then again, a magnitude 7 earthquake is a thousand times more powerful than a magnitude 5. Think of Haiti in 2010, instead of Coney Island in 1884."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Pausing for a water break before beginning his descent, Menke ran his hand over another boulder and broke off a piece of crusty rock tripe, or lichen. \u201cVery low nutritional value,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if faced with a choice between eating rock tripe and dying, you eat rock tripe.\u201d"}]}
