I was almost out the door."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Later, on my way back home, I\u2019m waiting for a westbound train, shifting a bag of groceries, when someone texts me a clip, so I tap my screen to watch. In it a man in a dark-blue suit steps up to a waiting group. His back is to the camera. He\u2019s speaking to a woman and a tall red-headed man\u2014greeting them, or thanking them, or telling them goodbye. The clip is shaky, blurred. Someone made it by holding a phone in front of a TV screen. I can just make out the ticker; I catch \u201cIowa\u201d and \u201cWhite House.\u201d Then the man in the suit reaches out to touch the woman\u2019s arm. The woman steps away. I watch the clip again. It\u2019s not five seconds long. The man in the suit steps up to the group. He tries to touch her face. Not her arm, her face. The woman steps away. People are getting off the train. People are getting on. I have no idea who sent the clip. There\u2019s a number but no name."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now comes a coincidence. There\u2019s a man on this train with a too loud voice, a man in a dark-blue suit. At first he seems jolly, drunk. The westbound train goes \u201cHaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d He\u2019s friends with the whole world until he zeroes in on me. \u201cHello, wife,\u201d he says, taking steps in my direction. The train car lurches left. Then with a flash like a magic trick he produces a golden credit card and pops it in front of my face. He raises his eyebrows. Am I impressed? \u201cThis is my wife,\u201d he tells the train, but commuters stare out windows at the passing backs of mansions. The sun has nearly set. When we plunge into a tunnel he lifts that credit card up, high above my head. \u201cThe life breath of man is the lamp of the Lord,\u201d he says, his voice suddenly sonorous, his golden card a lantern now to guide us in the dark. Then the train comes to a stop. The doors slide open, but I don\u2019t move. But then I do, I run. I\u2019m halfway out. I\u2019ve timed it well. The doors are about to close. But the man in the suit is quick. His thinning hair and reek of booze. His hand is on my arm. \u201cHey,\u201d I say. But no one looks. I tear myself away. \u201cGoodbye, wife,\u201d he calls. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you another time.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Emerging from the station, I step inside the rain.

I can still feel the palm of his hand. Then all the way up the hill to my house I assume he is inside\u2014my actual husband, I mean, and I am his actual wife.

This was the morning rush hour. There was nowhere else to stand. As soon as the doors slid shut, the young man started to talk. He never stopped, under his breath, just stared at my stomach, my dress: \u201cSo nice, so nice, so nice.\u201d Describing it later, I laughed, but my husband was not amused. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing,\u201d I told him, even though I was. A few days later I saw the young man again, I saw his picture, I mean, a shot from a doorbell camera, while scrolling the neighborhood app. He\u2019d assaulted a woman not four blocks away, or tried to, on her porch steps, having followed her from the train."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now I am home and my family is not.

In Daphne you\u2019re on an island. You\u2019re a man who has lost something, and you wander around the island muttering to yourself. The island is beset by mist. The mist sprouts seabirds, cliffs. Go left down a path to the ocean. Turn right through a doorway and descend a flight of stairs. There\u2019s something else there: moaning. From somewhere deep inside, the island is trying to speak. To get closer to the source, you enter a dark cave. The farther in you go, the more you\u2019re able to see; the walls of the cave are glowing blue with something alive or dead. You can just make out your booted feet. The moaning grows louder. Yet the first-person player\u2019s muttering can be heard above everything else, his footsteps on the rocky path, my child alone in their room. I hear it like a song at night: mutter, moan, and step."}, {"role": "body", "text": "But now their computer is sleeping. I shut a bedroom window.

No candles. No meat. At dinner she\u2019d read Goethe with rice pudding. \u201cHalf of me is still Paula Becker,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand the other half is acting as if it were.\u201d But since I have to be on campus by eight, into the shining microwave I toss a frozen burrito.

Here is the staircase lined with dogwoods, which blossom-tunnels each spring, and then I pass the gates of the Experimental Prairie. I stop beside a bench. \u201cHello where are you?\u201d I text. A plastic sign near the concrete path introduces the grasses by name. Sideoats grama. Fowl Manna. \u201cThe cluster of flowers,\u201d it says, \u201cis called an inflorescence.\u201d Most of the plants come up to my chest, but here and there a thistle rises high above everything else, its bulbous purple head atop a thin green stalk. The tallest thistle brings to mind a camera, possibly alive, a sentient alien technology transmitting news of Earth. \u201cCursed is the ground because of you,\u201d God allegedly said. \u201cBoth thorns and thistles it shall grow.\u201d But I often feel like a thistle myself, a bulbous inflorescence, transmitting news of Earth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Inside the lecture hall the walls are lined with latecomers who couldn\u2019t get a seat, and between these standing people are paintings from the eighties by a former professor\u2019s wife, the people in them color-blocked and bent.

She places her glass on the lectern, but she sets it down in such a way that her face is inside the water. That is, from where I sit in the room, the water in the cup contains her entire face. Anyway, I think, they\u2019re probably back by now, with homework spread out on the table, and, I hope, feeding the cat. \u201cYou need to get back to me please,\u201d I type, then set my phone to silent. The visitor begins. She\u2019s reading us a story about a woman on a trip. The woman has lost her glasses in a desolate public space. A stranger, a man, offers to help. He leads her down a sidewalk. It\u2019s starting to get dark, but the two continue to walk. Someone beside me sneezes. I quickly slip back in. The story is like a spell. There\u2019s a road, a woman, upheaval.

Continue straight on the forking path and you\u2019ll approach a garden wall. It\u2019s a garden in the mist, a former garden, overgrown, and perched atop a cliff. But even within the garden walls you must listen to his muttering, contemplate his regret. He is sorry, he is suffering, that much is perfectly clear. You pass driftwood crosses, orange poppies, clumps of yellow gorse. The sky is like a painting. You approach the edge of the cliff. \u201cIt\u2019s a graphic masterpiece,\u201d my child said, quoting an online review."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Something is waiting to happen, I think.

I turn off my phone and turn it back on, but this produces no new texts, no e-mails, and no missed calls. So I rehearse what I\u2019ve been told: I\u2019ve been told that I worry too much. I\u2019ve been told that I resist trusting the signs when things are going O.K. But when are things ever O.K.? Bad things, I know, enormously bad, are happening all the time. And the little things add up, like my kid spending recess alone, again, eating alone at lunch, or how distracted my husband has been, how lately he shifts his face so I\u2019m kissing only his cheek, or how he keeps forgetting to bolt the back door even though he knows the doorknob lock is broken, so I\u2019m regularly coming home to a house that\u2019s been unlocked for hours, meaning anybody walking past might have stepped inside our kitchen, fingered the photos on our fridge, sneaked down into the basement\u2014"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A colleague calls my name.

He\u2019d gone to college in the area, he\u2019d said. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time here,\u201d I\u2019d written back. \u201cYes,\u201d I agreed, \u201cit\u2019s beautiful.\u201d He mentioned the currents, the air, how good his body felt whenever he was there. The town was on the ocean and there were clumps of bright-pink sweet peas on the sides of all the roads. I\u2019d forgotten this exchange, but now I remembered that, even then, I hadn\u2019t been able to place him. I\u2019d just thought I recognized his name. I remembered now, too, how typing sweet peas had felt flirtatious, alone as I was in that other place, speaking privately with a man, though perhaps that feeling had more to do with how intensely I\u2019d admired the flowers, and again I\u2019d assumed he was someone I\u2019d corresponded with before. But now I checked and he was not. I didn\u2019t seem to know him, and I was unsure how or why he thought that he knew me. Still, I figured, he must. Another message sounded. \u201cWhich pumpkin patch?\u201d it said. I didn\u2019t respond. Minutes later: \u201cDo you know where the pumpkin patch is?\u201d Then: \u201cCan you send directions?\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d I finally wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know where it is.

But I hadn\u2019t told my husband about the messages from that summer, or the ones that morning. What was there to tell? I heard the stranger say my name. I heard him say, \u201cShe knows me.\u201d I shook my head in the kitchen. My husband asked him to wait. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know,\u201d I answered.

She was moving down the road, scared but also desperate, for all her own good reasons, moving toward something bad. But plot is so seductive. You don\u2019t really want it to stop. Or you don\u2019t know how to stop it. Then I realized the fog was gone. We were high up on a bridge, high above the river. Had the river swallowed the fog? But the river looked like nothing.

Despite the darkness, I can see now that it looks just as they described: a single track in a parking lot surrounded by fields of hay. There\u2019s one other passenger left on the train. I follow as she disembarks. She carries a sweatshirt, a purse. She seems to know where she\u2019s going. I follow her down the ramp. She pretends she doesn\u2019t see me, but I follow her all the way. I\u2019m bad at talking to strangers, unless they ask for help. She doesn\u2019t ask for help, or even turn around. She hurries toward a gray sedan, the only car in the lot. It reminds me of something I read once, but only distantly remember, about a woman who couldn\u2019t sleep. She hadn\u2019t slept for weeks. One night she drove to a train station and parked in the empty lot. She sat inside her car. It was hard to tell, as a reader, if she had fallen asleep at last or not when her car began to shake. She dropped the keys by her feet in fear. Someone was outside her car, rocking it back and forth. Now the woman slams her door. She looks at me through the window. She starts the gray sedan. I watch her drive away. I cross the empty lot. At the line where the lot turns into the field, I take my phone out of my pocket. There\u2019s no service, which means no message, and the battery is low. It\u2019s a relief just to leave it on the ground."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In her film \u201cThe Beaches of Agn\u00e8s,\u201d almost at the start, Agn\u00e8s Varda says to the camera that if we opened up people\u2019s bodies we would find landscapes inside. If you opened my body, she says, you would find beaches in me. Having crossed the field with its rolls of hay, then passed through a tangle of woods, I\u2019ve come to some other place, where the grass looks like a sea. The wind moves through the grasses, and I move through them, too. At first the grasses come up to my knees, and then after a minute they rise as high as my head. Other things surround me, too: star-shaped flowers in yellow and white, plastic netting, purple thistle, milkweed gone to seed. If you opened up my body, I think, this is what you\u2019d find, exactly the place where I\u2019m standing. There\u2019s a cross-rhythm from the crickets, plus the hum of distant traffic, plus the sound of drying grasses moving in the wind. My body\u2019s obscured by the waving of plants.
