Harley Mann, the son of \u201ceducated White Northerners with an affection for abstract thought,\u201d and the narrator of this slow-build tragic novel, recounts his youth and lovestruck early adulthood at New Bethany, the South Florida Shaker settlement where he moved with his siblings and widowed mother in 1902. (The book takes its inspiration from audio recordings made by the real Mann in 1971.)

Gaddy (Norton). Tracing the development of the banjo, \u201ca uniquely American instrument, crafted by people of African descent,\u201d this meticulous history also illuminates the difficulties of unearthing a story rooted in the experiences of the enslaved. Gaddy close-reads every early depiction of the banjo she can find\u2014a priest observing a calinda dance in Martinique in 1694, a 1785 watercolor from a plantation in South Carolina\u2014while remaining critically alert to the overwhelmingly white (and usually pro-slavery) perspectives that document the instrument\u2019s existence prior to the Civil War.

Farrell (Penguin Press). A sense of promise lost and regained imbues this biography of a figure whose long career encompassed the ascendancy of liberalism, its decline under Reagan, and the country\u2019s descent into today\u2019s partisanship. Kennedy continually reached across the aisle even as he saw the era of coalition-building come to an end. Hobbled by his struggle to measure up to his brothers, and by the grim shadow of the Chappaquiddick incident, he was nonetheless a standard-bearer of the left who, in his last years, helped seed a newly resilient and forward-looking strain of liberalism. By tracing this life of tragedy, tenacity, and service, Farrell draws a complex portrait of a man who, like his family\u2014and perhaps his nation\u2014was \u201calways running to keep ahead of the darkness.\u201d"}]}
