The first thing I saw one recent afternoon at L’Ami Pierre, a new French café in midtown, was a man with a hunk of baguette hanging from his mouth. The moment was not staged. The man was on the move, holding the rest of the paper-sleeved loaf in the crook of his arm as he pulled on his jacket. The bread had been genuinely irresistible.

It seemed plausible, before I tried it, that this baguette could be the best in the world. L’Ami Pierre (149 W. 51st St.) sits across a pedestrian walkway from the restaurant Le Bernardin, and, though the businesses are not technically affiliated, they have in common Eric Ripert, Le Bernardin’s longtime chef and co-owner. In September, Ripert opened L’Ami Pierre with his friend Pierre-Antoine Raberin, a former co-president of the macaron brand Ladurée. (Ripert serves mostly as a consultant, but his name is on the awning.)

In November, Le Bernardin turned fifty. Its founders, the siblings Maguy and Gilbert Le Coze, opened the seafood-focussed restaurant on the Left Bank of Paris in 1972, and moved it to New York in 1986. Ripert, who is fifty-seven, began working there in 1991. In the decades since, he has managed to maintain the highest accolades—Michelin stars, Times stars, top positioning on local and global best-of lists—and has become a celebrity.

On another afternoon, I went to Le Bernardin alone for lunch. I drank champagne, and ate a precisely circular disk of scallop tartare topped with a generous quenelle of caviar, then medallions of lobster in a verjus sabayon, then a plump fillet of halibut over sunchoke-truffle purée, surrounded by tiny, toylike carrots, roasted to perfection. For dessert, I spooned chocolate pot de crème and caramel out of a hollowed eggshell. The food was beautiful, the service impeccable. I couldn’t take my eyes off a couple sitting a few tables over. Both were dressed to the nines but their manner was utterly blasé, as if this hushed, almost holy dining room were a mere cafeteria.

The man with the baguette seemed, somehow, to have had a more sensual experience. It would be hard to argue that L’Ami Pierre’s baguette is the best in the world, or even in New York, but I am willing to make a case that there’s nothing more luxurious than a jambon-beurre, the classic French sandwich of ham and butter. The version at L’Ami Pierre fulfills its basic promise. With a shiny, golden, crackly crust and a soft but chewy crumb, the baguette, baked on the premises, holds up to its luscious fillings.

The café’s grab-and-go salads on refrigerated shelves—chicken Caesar; spinach with goat cheese and pine nuts—left me cold, and a butternut-squash soup was on the bitter end of earthy. But the viennoiseries—particularly the pain aux raisins—sang with clear notes of butter, as did a chocolate-chip cookie, further distinguished by its unusual, tart-like shape, slightly dipped in the middle, with steep, crisp edges and rectangular morsels of dense, rich chocolate.

A few blocks away, Ignacio Mattos shows us what can happen when a chef of the highest pedigree lends expertise to the pursuit of small daily pleasures, in addition to rarefied multicourse dining. At tables on a covered “terrazza” at Lodi (1 Rockefeller Plaza), his Milan-inspired café, you can order a lavish meal. Don’t miss the elegant squiggles of ravishing chicken-liver pâté on crostini, or the bone-in pork Milanese, when available. Inside are a coffee bar and a bakery that uphold the same standards more casually, astonishing amid the sterile salad bars of midtown. An ordinary cardboard container might contain an extraordinary farro, cabbage, and prosciutto soup, or a lentil salad, crunchy with fennel. The other morning, as I sat sipping a macchiato and eating an excellent maritozzo—a great pouf of brioche wearing a thick stripe of whipped cream and filled with vanilla custard—a nattily dressed older gentleman on the stool next to me was doing exactly the same. He gestured to the pastry with glee, explaining that it was from Rome, as was he, and set off into the chill with a pep in his step. (L’Ami Pierre $2.50-$14; Lodi pastries and panini $4-$15.)
