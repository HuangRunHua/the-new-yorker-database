Having all but died in body and spirit in his time with Vivienne, he found himself revived by unforeseeable love. It was in recognition of that new life—his vita nuova, befitting a perennial reader of Dante—that he presented Valerie with a book, on February 17, 1958. It was a first edition of “The Waste Land,” from 1922, and it still exists in the couple’s home, in London. The words that Eliot inscribed at the front of the poem have never been seen in public, until now:"},{"role":"quote","text":"This book belongs to Valerie, and so does Thomas Stearns Eliot, her husband.
