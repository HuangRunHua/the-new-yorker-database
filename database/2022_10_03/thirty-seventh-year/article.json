For lack of threat.\n\nIn this narrative, I will look\nAt you from a distance, as into the future,\n\nNo more real than I am,\nSitting here in my off-white body which I can feel\n\nBut is somehow less important, less\nUrgent than the problem it poses.\n\nSometimes, when I write this kind of narrative,\nMy mind flees and all I see above is text\n\nAt once strange, because I don’t know\nHow to hold it, and familiar, because I wrote it—\n\nSend out the memo, I’m nearly done here.\nHow much more of this life to live?

Who killed my father who lives?"}],"coverImageURL":"https://github.com/HuangRunHua/the-new-yorker-database/raw/main/database/2022_10_03/thirty-seventh-year/images/1.png","coverImageHeight":174}
