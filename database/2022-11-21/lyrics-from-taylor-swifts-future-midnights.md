## Night Wander

I stood in the hall / maternity-pants elastic worn thin / The night-light in the bathroom glowed / I whispered into the dark, “I am here.” / You kicked me in the bladder / and then ghosted

## “C”-Work

I gave my abs for you / lying marooned on the bed with swollen breasts, refused / You only want the bottle / in the hand of your dad / I only ever expected a thank-you

## First Memory

My love, will you remember / the first time you saw me wear shoes? / My love, will you remember / the elevator doors opening, too? / My love, will you remember / my face above the stroller / adjusting the pumpkin hat on your head? / My love, will you remember / when you looked up at me and grinned / because you had just pooped? / My love, I will

## February 3, 2025

When you met my ex in Whole Foods / you called him Dada and tugged at my shirt / revealing my old bra / You’ve known since February that I loved you like a son / because you are my son / my son / my son

## . . . Dinosaur

A love that makes the impossible possible / a train to a ferry to ikea / to replace your jättelik doll / the last one in the tri-state area / The babysitter put the dirty dishes back into the drawer / You screamed when I turned off “paw Patrol” / and told me that brontosauruses suck

## Stab Me in the Drop-Off Line

Still groggy from Ambien / I put on leggings and walk you to school / You tell your friend Zeus / “That’s my mom, but she usually wears dresses.” / And it isn’t even true

## Believe You

Just us / the humidifier glugs / I tell you again the Pumpkin Goblin won’t bite your feet / but you still cry beneath your poster of Vin Diesel / Baby, what did I do / to lose your trust?

## It’s Your Future

No curfew, but you take advantage / vomiting in the sink of our renovated master bathroom / “I don’t know what you’re talking about!” you scream / You were supposed to take the SAT this morning / I feed you Coke and Advil / On Instagram, you say I ruined your life / Just like all my haters

## Expulsion

You were nineteen / I was fifty-five / You and your roommate / in the junior common room gyrate / rapping under the name BreastWrk / setting off indoor fireworks / And you didn’t even / ask for my help / So don’t come home to me, baby / when you are expelled

## Mom, a Pop Mogul

A memoir, and I’m so proud / I preordered enough copies to fill the Nashville library / Page five and you’re already calling me “touchy” / even though I still have all your old onesies / I can’t read another word / How could you make art / about people you love? / How could you make art / about people you love?
