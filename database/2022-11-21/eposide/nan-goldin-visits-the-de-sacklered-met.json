She beelined for the Temple of Dendur, in the sunlit expanse that, until last winter, was known as the Sackler Wing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the new name?\u201d Goldin (red curls, black suit) asked, sounding battle-worn but amused. \u201cOh, there is no new name. The Ex-Sackler Room!\u201d She eyed the sandstone temple, completed around 10 B.C.E. and awarded to the Met in 1967. \u201cTalk about spoils of other societies, right?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m starting to realize that\u2019s what all museums are\u2014collections of the spoils of civilization. But I still love them.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reason that the wing is temporarily nameless is Goldin, who is known for her louche countercultural photography. In 2014, she had wrist surgery and was prescribed OxyContin; she developed a three-year addiction, during which she had a near-fatal overdose of fentanyl. In recovery, she read up on the drug that had unraveled her and on the family that had amassed a fortune from it\u2014the Sacklers, who own Purdue Pharma, and whose name Goldin recognized from museum walls. She started a group called pain (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now) to hold the Sacklers accountable. \u201cMy first motivation was to shame them, to ruin their reputation among their peers,\u201d she said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Goldin\u2019s rebirth as an opioid activist is the subject of the new documentary \u201cAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed,\u201d directed by Laura Poitras, who joined Goldin at the Met. The film, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, opens with footage from March 10, 2018, the day that Goldin led some thirty activists into the Sackler Wing, where they chanted (\u201cSacklers lie, thousands die!\u201d), threw fake prescription bottles into the reflecting pool, and staged a die-in. \u201cThe Met is my favorite museum in New York, and this is the jewel of the Sacklers, so it was obvious that we should start here,\u201d Goldin said. At the die-in, she recalled with a throaty laugh, \u201ca little boy came up to his father and said, \u2018Can I die, too?\u2019 \u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Goldin sat on a stone wall outside the temple with her feet up, as though the place were her rec room. Poitras, in a red blouse and knee-high boots, sat upright, as if at a job interview. \u201cSomething that was on my deep, deep wish list for the film was, you know, presumably they held on to the surveillance footage of that day,\u201d Poitras said. \u201cWe never got it.\u201d Surveillance is a running theme for Poitras, whose previous subjects include Edward Snowden (\u201cCitizenfour\u201d) and Julian Assange (\u201cRisk\u201d). The two women met in 2014, when Poitras screened \u201cCitizenfour\u201d at a film festival in Portugal and Goldin was on the jury. They reconnected years later, when Goldin was well into her anti-Sackler campaign and turning it into a documentary. \u201cI volunteered,\u201d Poitras said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI thought, Laura Poitras! I\u2019m not important enough. I don\u2019t have any, like, state secrets,\u201d Goldin said. Soon afterward, Goldin and another pain member were followed by a mysterious man in a car. \u201cSo then she really wanted to do it\u2014surveillance!\u201d Goldin recalled. (Purdue has denied hiring an investigator to monitor Goldin.) Before a die-in at the Guggenheim, which has since removed the Sackler name from its education center, Goldin had lunch at the Frick. \u201cThe guards got really nervous,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI think museums were on the lookout for us.\u201d In 2019, she refused to participate in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in London unless it stopped taking Sackler money; the museum dropped a million-pound donation. \u201cThen things started to roll,\u201d she said. \u201cMore and more museums stopped taking the money. But we still wanted them to take down the name, and that took a lot longer.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "One day last December, Goldin got a tipoff that the Met was finally scrubbing the Sackler name. \u201cWe screamed,\u201d she recalled. She and Poitras rushed to the museum: the lettering on the glass doorway to the temple was already gone, with just a smudge left. (Not getting to shoot the removal, Poitras admitted, was \u201ca heartbreak.\u201d) All in all, the Met erased the name from seven spaces."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Goldin and Poitras took an elevator up to the Asian Art collection, where a gallery named for Arthur M. Sackler, who died in 1987, still remains. \u201cThe family claims he\u2019s innocent, because he died before OxyContin,\u201d Goldin said. But Arthur pioneered a system of marketing Valium to doctors which encouraged them to prescribe it even to those without psychiatric symptoms, all while burnishing his reputation through philanthropy and art collection. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Goldin lamented, peering up at the gold inscription. Otherwise, her trip through the Met was a victory lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to go after now, but I feel like I\u2019ve got the power,\u201d she said. In the meantime, \u201cI\u2019ve been engrossed by my own work. Huge retrospective of my life, called \u2018This Will Not End Well.\u2019 \u201d"}]}
