There was surely some better word than \u201cdo,\u201d but Annie couldn\u2019t, for the moment, think of it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cConduct,\u201d Ian suggested in his big-brotherly way, though with a touch of tongue-in-cheek. Would that make him a conductor, then, Annie thought, not a minister?

Sitting beside him while he drove, she reached out and touched his shoulder, just a light scuffing with her knuckles. Ian almost flinched."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Annie, one of the effects of losing her father was that she also lost words. They suddenly went missing. Even the words that did present themselves could seem odd and unreliable. \u201cMinister,\u201d for example, was an odd word."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Their meeting with the minister was itself about words, since the main purpose of it was to tell the minister things about their father so that the minister, in his address at the funeral, could, in turn, say things about him. This, they both felt, was essentially, as Ian had put it, a \u201cscam.\u201d The minister had never known their father, and they now had to prime this man, whom they themselves didn\u2019t know, so that he could speak about their father as if he\u2019d been a bosom pal. So a better word than \u201cminister,\u201d Annie thought, might be \u201cimpostor.\u201d Obviously, it was not a better word. This thing, the funeral of their father, would be a pretense. Yet they had to pretend that it wasn\u2019t a pretense. Was there a word for that?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In any case, their meeting with the minister posed a basic difficulty: what to tell him about their father? They were already coping with the greatest of difficulties: their father had died. And this difficulty had confronted them with an equally great difficulty, which they hadn\u2019t exactly discussed with each other: the fact\u2014of which they had never been so sharply aware\u2014that they themselves would die, that they themselves were mortal. That they were, as it were, \u201cnext,\u201d and one day their own children might go to a minister, in just this way, with a similar purpose, and find themselves in similar perplexity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the car, she\u2019d reached out and touched Ian\u2019s shoulder in the lightest way, yet it had caused his own light touch, on the steering wheel\u2014she\u2019d seen it\u2014to tighten. She\u2019d felt the tensed and tingling Ian inside Ian. If it had been the other way round, he would have felt the Annie inside her.

They both had families. She was Annie Stevens. She hadn\u2019t minded, twenty years ago, changing her name.

Her dead father was the man who\u2019d \u201cgiven her away.\u201d What a ridiculous expression. She\u2019d clutched his arm and he\u2019d . . . conducted her up the aisle."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ian didn\u2019t have her difficulty, or theoretical treachery.

Especially as the minister would be saying something, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Poor Ian. And then she\u2019d suddenly declared that she would read a poem. She didn\u2019t have to do anything. She could just sit in the front row, if she wanted, a mere spectator, with her mother. But she felt that she should be part of this thing, do her bit.

Her decision hadn\u2019t entirely surprised Annie and Ian.

It was a sort of prerogative. Annie had even begun to think\u2014though she didn\u2019t tell Ian this\u2014that there was something to be said for it. It had its own odd integrity."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Almost at the last moment, their mother had said, as if some more interesting opportunity had come up, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go with you.

Most of forty years ago. In Kirby Street."}, {"role": "body", "text": "One way or the other, before meeting the minister they\u2019d not been disposed to like him. Annie had seen that this was unfair. The poor man would only be doing his job and no one else would be \u201cdoing\u201d their father. So she\u2019d said to Ian, \u201cLet\u2019s be nice to him.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Yet, from the start, she hadn\u2019t liked him, and being nice to him wasn\u2019t so easy. Liking or disliking people was a complicated thing. His name was Shepherd. Well. \u201cCall me Tim,\u201d he said. He had thin sandy hair, hazy blue eyes, and an apparently ineradicable smile. He spoke with a voice that was patient, kindly, and persuasive. What was not to like about him? But she didn\u2019t like him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hardly had she entered his presence than Annie found herself thinking of Betty Sykes, the mother of her school friend Sally Sykes, and a neighbor of theirs in Kirby Street in the days when she and Ian had been their mother\u2019s \u201cchicks.\u201d Betty Sykes! Betty Sykes could spend a great deal of her time, arms firmly folded before her, in her front doorway, leaning on the frame, eying the street up and down, ready to give lip. Hers was the doorway to No. 33, across the road and along a bit."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Betty Sykes didn\u2019t give a cuss what came out of her mouth\u2014and much of it was cusses\u2014or who listened. As a small girl, Annie had often listened, and, against all the evidence, she had liked Betty Sykes. She\u2019d even felt, with a child\u2019s strange instinct, that Betty Sykes was a good woman with a warm heart inside her. She possessed some vital spark. Betty Sykes had always had, at any rate, a smile for her, little Annie at No. 12."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then it also came back to Annie, in front of this smiling minister, that her father, Ted Holroyd, now dead, had once said to her mother, Mary Holroyd, after the two of them had been talking, and perhaps not kindly, about Betty Sykes, \u201cAye, but all the same\u2014\u200b\u2019andsome woman.\u201d And had instantly regretted (young as she was, she\u2019d noticed it) that those words had come out of his mouth."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kirby Street. Betty Sykes! Sally Sykes! How it all came back. Now here she was meeting this impeccably benign minister and she didn\u2019t like him. And she and Ian were here to tell him things about their father."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The minister hadn\u2019t seemed too troubled by the absence of their mother. He\u2019d told them, in fact, that, quite often, the widow would not feel \u201cup to it,\u201d and he\u2019d find himself talking, as now, to sons or daughters, or both. His smile seemed undimmable. It was perfectly all right. And he\u2019d meet her anyway \u201cat the occasion,\u201d as he put it. It was strange to hear their mother referred to as \u201cthe widow.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The minister had first gone through various practical matters that they would need to know about the funeral. He explained that they would have to put together an Order of Service\u2014the little leaflet that would be handed to everyone to refer to. And to keep, if they wished. There was still time for doing this."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With such things, she and Ian needed only to listen and nod. But when it came to the nub of the matter, their father\u2019s life and what was to be said about it, they both found themselves bewildered. They hadn\u2019t done much \u201chomework\u201d; they hadn\u2019t explored it properly between them. Perhaps they\u2019d thought\u2014foolishly\u2014that they might leave it to their mother. Or perhaps they\u2019d thought that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, it would take care of itself. He was their father, wasn\u2019t he? Did they need to do homework in order to talk about their own father? The idea was even distasteful."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ian, in any case, was concerned that the minister should not use up any \u201cmaterial\u201d that he might need in his eulogy\u2014that there\u2019d be enough \u201cleft over\u201d for him to say. But what was this material?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The fact was that, when the moment arrived, they didn\u2019t really know what to tell the minister. They didn\u2019t know what to say about their father, whom they\u2019d known all their lives. They were curiously at a loss. At a loss. Exactly."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Or was it simply that the \u201cmaterial\u201d itself was just\u2014well, rather thin? They hadn\u2019t dared say this to each other. Their own father, and his material was thin?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "He had lived most of his life in the same Yorkshire town. He had spent most of his working life in the same place: Batley\u2019s, as in Batley\u2019s Blankets. He had worked in blankets. What could you say? Then he\u2019d retired. Sixty-five and just in time, since Batley\u2019s had soon retired, too. Or closed down. Then, with unexpected and almost unseemly speed, Ted and Mary Holroyd had flown south, to where their son and their daughter had flown long before, finding jobs, lives, marriages, and children of their own. Suddenly, there they all were, the Holroyds, living in deepest Surrey."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And then, quite quickly again, it had seemed, Ted and Mary had gone into \u201csheltered accommodation.\u201d Quite snazzy sheltered accommodation, as it happened, largely paid for\u2014but did the minister need to know this?\u2014by her and Ian. And Ted Holroyd had taken up golf. Who would have thought it, Ted Holroyd playing golf? But it was what retired people did. And what was in it for the minister? \u201cHe played golf.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not a good subject, anyway. Since, one morning, in his seventy-sixth year, Ted Holroyd had died of a heart attack at the golf course. No, not actually playing golf, let alone at the eighteenth hole, having completed his best round ever, which would have made a perfect story\u2014and Ian would have wanted to keep it for himself\u2014but still in the car park, pulling out his clubs from the boot of his car."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And that was about it. What more was to be said?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "So why did her mind keep rushing back to Kirby Street?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "At one point the minister, who\u2019d jotted a few things down in a notebook and said, \u201cI see . . . I see,\u201d had asked, with his still patient and now coaxing smile, \u201cI wonder if you could give me\u2014well, a sketch of the man himself.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A sketch? What did that mean? Was their father to be turned into a sketch? Annie, who had been slightly coming round to seeing things from the minister\u2019s point of view, now found herself bridling. Even becoming, inside, a bit like Betty Sykes. Folding her arms. I\u2019ll give yer bloody sketch!"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the uncomfortable truth was that they struggled to give the minister even a sketch of their own father. Or, to put it another way, what they could give him seemed only\u2014sketchy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And poor Ian. What, indeed, was he going to say, if they couldn\u2019t even give the minister enough to be getting on with?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "But the minister hadn\u2019t seemed too deterred. His default position was undaunted capability.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll pick a good one. Nothing too long.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then the minister paused and for the first time looked a little tentative. His eyes darted between them."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cOne last thing I should mention. When people say things\u2014or just read them\u2014they sometimes . . . they sometimes break down.

His consoling and unavoidable arm had been extended toward her. This was the man who was going to \u201cdo\u201d her husband.
