Many noted concert halls around the country (Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Nashville, Dallas, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles) have distinguished pipe organs, which are used in orchestral works and also solo recitals. I\u2019m old enough to remember hearing the Aeolian-Skinner in Philharmonic Hall\u2019s earliest concerts\u2014in Mahler\u2019s Eighth Symphony, in Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Glagolitic Mass, and in the performances of a number of noteworthy recitalists, among them E. Power Biggs, Catharine Crozier, and Virgil Fox. Perhaps Deborah Borda and the Philharmonic\u2019s revolving door of music directors, in their attempts to attract a younger audience, have decided that a pipe organ is too old-fashioned. But they\u2019re wrong."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "James Hejduk"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Lincoln, Neb."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ross is one of the few critical voices who haven\u2019t gushed about the New York Philharmonic\u2019s renovation. He admits to finding the acoustics of the new hall imperfect, and mentions other shortcomings, like its soon-to-be-outdated furnishings. But I wish he had noted the renovation\u2019s well-publicized cost, five hundred and fifty million dollars. I am not a donor or a musician. I am a writer with a small income. There is value in investing in performance spaces, but I wonder whether such an exorbitant sum might have been spent in more beneficial ways, by funding grants or youth programs or by providing artists with housing or other direct support."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Renee M.

I\u2019d like to expand upon his mention of an important literary influence on Dylan\u2019s music: ancient Greek and Roman poets. There are echoes of many classical poets\u2014especially Homer, Catullus, Vergil, Horace, and Ovid\u2014in Dylan\u2019s songs. He devoted a section of his Nobel lecture to his appreciation of Homer\u2019s Odyssey, drawing a comparison between Odysseus\u2019 experiences and his own. (\u201cIn a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you,\u201d he said.) This influence is explored in more detail in the book \u201cWhy Bob Dylan Matters,\u201d by the Harvard classicist and Dylanologist Richard Thomas, which considers classical poems alongside important moments in Dylan\u2019s life in an illuminating way."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Robert J.

Having seen Dylan live a half-dozen times in the past twenty-five years, I can say that his late-career performances are indeed mesmerizing. Dylan\u2019s shows of this era, featuring a core group of musicians\u2014including the bassist Tony Garnier (who has accompanied him for three decades) and the guitarist Charlie Sexton\u2014are marked by both the mood of jazz and the precision of chamber music. His craggy, expressive voice is often projected with a crystal clarity, owing to the state-of-the-art sound systems of the elegant venues where he now performs. Audiences at these shows find a thrilling combination of older songs newly envisioned and more recent classics. I\u2019m grateful that Dylan is still presenting his music live, in singular ways."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Chris Wellin"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Normal, Ill."}]}
