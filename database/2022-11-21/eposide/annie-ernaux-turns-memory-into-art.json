Does winning a prize\u2014the prize\u2014turn you into someone else? In the minds of others it does. Although Ernaux has never been preoccupied with her Nobel odds, she has long been considered a contender by those who delight in speculating about which of the world\u2019s writers the Swedes will crown next. Last year, at Nobel time, Ernaux left her home in the Paris suburb of Cergy for a physical-therapy appointment and found herself barraged by journalists who had camped out in front of her gate, \u201cjust in case.\u201d The day before this year\u2019s announcement, people at Gallimard, her French publisher, warned her not to go out or answer the phone the next morning. She obliged, even when she saw a Swedish number popping up repeatedly on her caller I.D. (\u201cA bad joke,\u201d she assumed. She has been hoaxed in the past.) A few minutes after one in the afternoon, she turned on the transistor radio in her kitchen and heard her own name. \u201cIt was perfectly unreal,\u201d Ernaux said. She was alone with her cats."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Six days later, I met Ernaux in the handsome Tribeca loft of Daniel Simon, the head of her American publisher, Seven Stories Press. At eighty-two, she is still tall (thanks to genetics) and blond (by choice). She had paired her sober black trousers and shoes with splashes of color: a scarf the green of Giverny in summertime, a fuchsia blouse. On the coffee table in front of her was an open Tupperware filled with brownies and macaroons, the remnants of a celebratory lunch that had just been held in her honor at the Press\u2019s office, around the corner. Officially, Ernaux was in town to attend the New York Film Festival screening of \u201cThe Super 8 Years,\u201d a movie that she made with her son David Ernaux-Briot, but the prize had turned the trip into an impromptu victory tour. At the Walter Reade Theatre, and at previously scheduled events at Barnard and the French bookstore Albertine, she was greeted by packed, jubilant houses. There were dinners to be attended, stacks of books to be signed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ernaux\u2019s books tend to be short, often around a hundred pages, and ferociously sharp, written in a direct, declarative style that she has called \u201cl\u2019\u00e9criture plate\u201d: \u201cflat writing.\u201d (\u201cI shall never experience the pleasure of juggling with metaphors or indulging in stylistic play,\u201d she once wrote, sounding as resolved as a Franciscan friar\u2014and a little regretful, too.) A reader might expect a certain austerity in Ernaux\u2019s manner, but she likes being around people, and it shows. Maybe because she spent years as a middle-school teacher, she is of the \u201cThere are no stupid questions\u201d camp when it comes to audience Q. & A.s. Before we met, I had thought that Ernaux, who had not been to New York in more than two decades, might like to see something of the city, but I worried that all the ruckus might have tired her out.

I have to live it to the fullest.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the course of her nearly fifty-year career, Ernaux has published more than twenty books. The first few were what you and I would call autobiographical novels: the protagonists, young women to whom Ernaux lent her own thoughts and experiences, are clearly self-portraits. Pretty soon, though, Ernaux pulled down the scrim of fiction and adopted the first person. Her \u201cI\u201d is not a put-on, some coy invitation to the reader to try to untangle what is real from what is false. Ernaux works exclusively from the factual material of life\u2014her life. But how to shape and present the facts? How to account for their particular power and the way that the truth changes, or doesn\u2019t, when exposed to the forces of memory and time? These are profound artistic questions, fundamental to both Ernaux\u2019s creative practice and her moral principles. \u201cI believe that any experience, whatever its nature, has the inalienable right to be chronicled,\u201d she has written. \u201cThere is no such thing as a lesser truth.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That credo may explain why Ernaux has proved inexhaustible to herself as a subject.

She is more like a diver, glimpsing something glimmering far beneath the surface of consciousness and plunging after it. To this impulse she likes to pair forensic methods. Photographs and newspaper records can be as important as her own journal entries as tools for reconstructing the past:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Naturally I shall not opt for narrative, which would mean inventing reality instead of searching for it.

It took her nearly forty-five years to try to make sense of what this terrifying event meant to her, and, by the book\u2019s end, she is still not sure that she has. \u201cI have always wanted to write the sort of book that I find it impossible to talk about afterward, the sort of book that makes it impossible for me to withstand the gaze of others,\u201d she writes. This paradoxical wish, to reveal the darkest parts of herself with such pitiless accuracy that she will be forced to fall silent once and for all, is an extraordinary expression of writerly ambition. In any case, it has still not come true."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The purpose of Ernaux\u2019s writing, she believes, is not merely to record things that have happened but to \u201cmake things exist.\u201d This is strong, but it is hardly the strongest thing she has to say about her work. \u201cI am a medium,\u201d she told me. \u201cI feel that I\u2019m someone who can transmit things.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Much of what Ernaux transmits\u2014what it is to grow up working class in a society that is contemptuous of workers; what it is to be a woman dispossessed of her body by the laws of the state, or by the overpowering prerogatives of desire\u2014has made her a literary model, even a hero, to those who have shared similar experiences or points of view. Ernaux\u2019s book \u201cHappening,\u201d in which she describes seeking an illegal abortion as a twenty-three-year-old student, is a feminist touchstone; it was adapted, last year, into a movie by the director Audrey Diwan. Writers like Didier Eribon, \u00c9douard Louis, and Marie NDiaye are openly indebted to Ernaux in both substance and style. Ernaux has been asked if she is proud to have been adopted as a kind of literary godmother, or even as a spokesperson, but she feels that \u201cpride\u201d is the wrong word. \u201cI never wanted to write for,\u201d Ernaux told me. \u201cI write from.\u201d Still, she was moved by the joy with which readers greeted the Nobel announcement.

Relentlessly personal in her art, she has, in public life, taken on the role of the \u00e9crivaine engag\u00e9e, outspokenly committed to a host of left-wing political causes, and, while she was being appreciated in New York, accusations lobbed by her conservative detractors were flying fast in France. Ernaux was an anti-Semite (she supports the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement as a way of advancing the Palestinian cause), an Islamofascist (she considers French antipathy to the hijab to be a means of silencing women), a pedophile (her latest book, \u201cLe Jeune Homme,\u201d recounts an affair that Ernaux had in her fifties with a man some thirty years her junior), wokiste (she is a proponent of #MeToo and of the gilets jaunes). \u201cDecidedly, this \u2018academy\u2019 of old shriveled bigwigs has gone a step further into the absurd and the indecent,\u201d railed one editorial beneath the headline \u201cthe nobel in literature definitively discredited.\u201d In the conservative newspaper Le Figaro, a writer disparaged the decision to award the \u201chigh priestess of autofiction\u201d for a \u201clifetime spent writing about herself.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThey think I\u2019m not legitimate,\u201d Ernaux said to me. \u201cWhat disgusts them is that there are people who have found, in literature, something that speaks to them, and that those people aren\u2019t C.E.O.s or company bosses.\u201d Ernaux is also the first French woman to win the Nobel, \u201cand that doesn\u2019t work for them, at all.\u201d For years, she has dealt with sexist criticism of her work, and not just from the right.

Still, it depressed her. In the uproar, Ernaux saw a renewal of the frightening wave of outrage that had engulfed her ten years ago, when she published a column in Le Monde decrying \u201cA Literary Elegy for Anders Breivik,\u201d a barely concealed apologia for the Norwegian mass murderer by Richard Millet, an author and editor at Gallimard. While condemning Breivik\u2019s crimes, Millet blamed them on multiculturalism and the erosion of European Christian identity; Ernaux called his text \u201ca fascist pamphlet that dishonors literature.\u201d Three days later, Millet stepped down from Gallimard\u2019s prestigious reading committee. Many others shared Ernaux\u2019s disgust\u2014for instance, J. M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio, Nobelled in 2008. But Ernaux\u2019s column, counter-signed by a hundred and eighteen fellow-writers, was seized upon as a flash point. L\u2019affaire Richard Millet became a kind of referendum on what wasn\u2019t yet termed cancel culture, with Ernaux denounced as a harridan intent on enforcing politically correct censorship at the expense of a man\u2019s career. \u201cI was called a killer,\u201d Ernaux said.

A \u201ctransfuge\u201d is a defector. But Ernaux herself uses the term, partly as an objective description of her situation as a woman who, by dint of education, rose to the middle class and then, by force of talent, to the cultural \u00e9lite\u2014and partly, it can seem, as a kind of deserved epithet that expresses her own ambivalent feelings at having moved so far from the world of her parents. In 1983, when she published \u201cA Man\u2019s Place,\u201d an account of her father\u2019s life, she took as an epigraph a quotation by Jean Genet: \u201cMay I venture an explanation: writing is the ultimate recourse for those who have betrayed.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Annie Duchesne was born in September, 1940, in Lillebonne, a town in Normandy where her parents ran a caf\u00e9-grocery. Since the nineteenth century, the area, which sits in a valley north of the Seine, had been dominated by cotton mills. \u201cEven now, to mention the Valley in prewar times is to evoke images of horror: the highest concentration of alcoholics and unmarried mothers, the damp running down the walls, and the babies dying from diarrhea within two hours,\u201d Ernaux writes in \u201cA Woman\u2019s Story\u201d (1987), a companion to \u201cA Man\u2019s Place\u201d about her mother. For her parents, though, life there was a step up. Both Alphonse Duchesne and Blanche Dum\u00e9nil left school at the age of twelve, Alphonse to labor as a farmhand, Blanche for a job in a margarine factory. They met while working at a rope factory in Yvetot, Blanche\u2019s home town. Alphonse was tall, owned a bicycle, and went to the cinema. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look common,\u201d Blanche liked to say. Seven years younger, she was vivacious, proud, and temperamental, quick to laugh and quick to shout, a red-headed Catholic who loved to read novels and refused to miss Mass. They married in 1928, to the disdain of Alphonse\u2019s sisters, who had worked as housemaids and looked down on factory girls. Blanche scorned them back, along with anyone else who made a living \u201clicking the arses of the rich.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Blanche proved to be the engine of the marriage, the dreamer and the doer.

The clientele was poor, and often asked for credit; Alphonse worked other jobs to keep the family afloat. Then there was the German Occupation to deal with, and the chaotic scramble of rationing and rebuilding that followed the war. When Annie was five, the family moved to Yvetot and took over another, more profitable caf\u00e9-grocery, living in the rooms upstairs.

Language is never neutral, Ernaux says. The purpose of her \u201cflat\u201d style is political, not just artistic. She doesn\u2019t want to sentimentalize or aggrandize the lives of the working poor, to tilt toward the twin traps of pity and populism. She uses the kinds of richly \u201cnovelistic\u201d detail that a modern-day Dickens might make much of, but the effect is clinical, not colorful, as if we were seeing slides placed under a microscope: the sachets of garlic that were sewn inside children\u2019s shirts when her father was small to protect against worms; the way that her paternal grandmother, a woman of style, refused to piss standing up as other country people did; the way that her maternal grandmother, a woman of thrift, did the laundry with ash and used the stove\u2019s fading heat to dry plums. \u201cThis knowledge\u2014handed down from mother to daughter for many centuries\u2014stops at my generation,\u201d Ernaux writes. \u201cI am only the archivist.\u201d So she has taken the laundry ash and the dried plums and used them to produce a sociology of a lost world.

Both \u201cA Man\u2019s Place\u201d and \u201cA Woman\u2019s Story\u201d begin with a parent\u2019s death, and not just the death; before we have even met these people, Ernaux shows us their corpses. Here is her father, who died unexpectedly at home at the age of sixty-seven\u2014his open eyes, his bared gums, the spidery veins on his chest, even his penis, briefly exposed as his clothes are changed for burial\u2014and here is her mother, wrapped in a sheet at the nursing home where she spent her last years, stricken with Alzheimer\u2019s.

It won the Prix Renaudot; Ernaux heard from legions of readers, and not just French ones, who felt that she was writing to and about them. This is not how people tend to react to sociology.

Her teachers corrected her if she slipped into Norman dialect, and when she went home she corrected her parents. \u201cHow do you expect me to speak properly if you keep on making mistakes?\u201d Ernaux remembers asking her father, in tears. When, at nineteen, she left France to work as an au pair in London, her mother wrote her stiff letters reporting what was going on in the neighborhood, who had died, what the weather was like.

Ernaux had simply mailed the manuscript to Gallimard, telling no one."}, {"role": "body", "text": "People don\u2019t tend to film their arguments and fights. Ernaux has hinted at her husband\u2019s philandering, but, true to form, she is inclined to consider their separation to be as much a public phenomenon as a private one. \u201cAll around them, divorce proliferated,\u201d Ernaux writes, in \u201cThe Years,\u201d referring to her cohort of women who had grown up being told that premarital sex was a sin, and pregnancy out of wedlock a disaster, only to see the next generation met with \u201cunanimous approval\u201d when they dodged the altar. In 1981, Ernaux published her third novel, \u201cA Frozen Woman,\u201d an account of a young wife and mother who comes to feel suffocated by the constraints of domestic life. That is when the family videos end. Ernaux had left the marriage for good."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Now Ernaux came into her own. She published the books about her father and mother. She had an audience, a name. Then, in 1991, came \u201cSimple Passion,\u201d and everything readers thought they knew about this restrained, cerebral woman went out the window. \u201cFrom September last year, I did nothing else but wait for a man: for him to call me and come round to my place,\u201d Ernaux writes at the start. The sixty or so short pages that follow amount to a narrative of willing captivity. During the months of her affair with A., as she calls her lover, Ernaux bends toward him as a flower toward the sun. She stays at home when she should go out; she doesn\u2019t use the vacuum cleaner for fear of covering the phone\u2019s ring. A. is a foreigner, an Eastern European; his weakness for Western luxuries reminds Ernaux of herself as a teen-age \u201cparvenue,\u201d craving the dresses and vacations that her richer friends had. A. shares none of her intellectual interests, but so what? She herself can only listen to love songs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After A. returns home, Ernaux grows morbid. If he has given her aids, she thinks, \u201cat least he would have left me that.\u201d And yet, in this sex-saturated book, there is not a lot of sex. Ernaux is at her most graphic in the preface, where she describes watching an X-rated movie on TV, stunned by its matter-of-fact depiction of what for centuries had been taboo. Writing, she thinks, should try to achieve the same effect: \u201ca feeling of anxiety and stupefaction, a suspension of moral judgment.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cSimple Passion\u201d was a major best-seller, and no surprise; if you have experienced the sort of agony that Ernaux describes, you won\u2019t come across a more distilled depiction of it. Some readers, though, felt betrayed. When Ernaux was invited to give a talk at Wellesley, the students attacked her for being submissive. Didn\u2019t she claim to be a feminist? Yes, and that is what made \u201cSimple Passion\u201d so powerful, and so terrifying. Ernaux had managed to convey the force with which desire can render the rest of life\u2014the rest of the self\u2014instantly void. She wasn\u2019t advocating for women to lose their heads over a man. She was describing what it feels like when it happens, as you might describe a tornado that has flattened your house."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A decade later, Ernaux did something surprising and published excerpts of the diary she had kept during the affair. That book, \u201cGetting Lost,\u201d was released in the U.S. in September, in a translation by Alison L. Strayer. Here, finally, is the sex that Ernaux had mostly elided in \u201cSimple Passion\u201d\u2014the positions, the fluids\u2014and the torture of the waiting, unspooled in all its real-time wretchedness. \u201cMy whole life has been an effort to tear myself away from male desire, in other words, from my own desire,\u201d Ernaux confesses. (Maybe the Wellesley students had a point.) Ernaux is not, as a rule, a funny writer, but the friction between her finely developed mind and the tyrannical demands of her body produces moments of true comedy. When she loses a contact lens and finds it on her lover\u2019s penis, her first thought is of Zola, \u201cwho lost his monocle between the breasts of women.\u201d Then there is the gulf between her devotion to her lover\u2014\u201caddiction\u201d might be the better word\u2014and her awareness of his obvious mediocrity. Now called by his true initial, S., he turns out to be a thirty-five-year-old Soviet apparatchik whom the forty-eight-year-old Ernaux met on a writer\u2019s junket to the U.S.S.R. \u201cAgain I long to see him,\u201d she records. \u201cAnd yet what it all comes down to is this: he fucks, he drinks vodka, he talks about Stalin.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Here Ernaux risks indulgence. \u201cThe Years,\u201d which covers the period from 1941 to 2006 and is practically cosmic in its tone and scope, runs well over two hundred pages, but \u201cGetting Lost\u201d is somehow longer. What pushed her to publish? In the period following the affair, she told me, \u201cI was forbidden from reading the diary by a very jealous lover.\u201d She agreed to seal it in an envelope, where it stayed until their breakup, six years later. \u201cThen I read it, and I discovered that it had a fabulous unity. But it wasn\u2019t at all the same as \u2018Simple Passion.\u2019 It was another text. And I was another woman, too. I felt like I was reading a novel. It was the writing itself that was working on me, as if I didn\u2019t know what came next!\u201d This was the ecstatic surrender not of the lover but of the reader. Ernaux was transfixed by a fictional character, who happened to be herself."}, {"role": "body", "text": "This notion of becoming another woman\u2014of the self transfigured by time\u2014animates all of Ernaux\u2019s work. As she says in \u201cShame,\u201d writing about her vanished, younger self is one of only two ways she knows \u201cto bring the two of us together.\u201d (The other, orgasm, \u201cthe moment when my sense of identity and coherence is at its highest,\u201d is, needless to say, more ephemeral.) But, she explains in \u201cSimple Passion,\u201d the passage of time can also be a comfort, even a creative necessity:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Naturally I feel no shame in writing these things because of the time which separates the moment when they are written\u2014when only I can see them\u2014from the moment when they will be read by other people, a moment which I feel will never come. By then I could have had an accident or died; a war or a revolution could have broken out. This delay makes it possible for me to write today, in the same way I used to lie in the scorching sun for a whole day at sixteen, or make love without contraceptives at twenty: without thinking about the consequences."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Ernaux sometimes ends her books with the dates of their composition, as if to tie them to that precious period when she lived with them alone. \u201cHappening,\u201d published in 2000, was written between February and October of 1999, thirty-six years after the events it recounts. \u201cI had a sense of writing out of time,\u201d Ernaux told me. Abortion had been permitted in France since 1975. People took it for granted; no one seemed to be interested in commemorating the struggle, led by Simone Veil, to legalize it, or in remembering the horrors that women faced before. \u201cThere\u2019s a parade every Fourteenth of July,\u201d Ernaux said. \u201cWe celebrate that; we aren\u2019t supposed to forget. But if it concerns women? It\u2019s all over, no one needs to talk about it. I had the feeling that I would die one day and there would be no trace of it. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to transmit whatever it was that I needed to.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "What Ernaux needed to transmit, in that blunt, indelible book, was what it had been like to seek an abortion in the fall of 1963 and the winter of 1964, when anyone who performed an abortion, or sought one, or encouraged one, or even advocated for the use of contraception, could be fined and sent to prison. Ernaux was studying in Rouen when she discovered that she was pregnant. \u201cSomehow I felt there existed a connection between my social background and my present condition,\u201d she writes. So much for her fancy education: \u201cMy ass had caught up with me, and the thing growing inside me I saw as the stigma of social failure.\u201d Even so, she thought that getting the abortion would be easy. She had read about abortions in novels; she had heard women in Yvetot discussing them under their breath. She knew that it would be painful. She had no idea that she could die."}, {"role": "body", "text": "She learned. Although \u201cHappening\u201d is written with Ernaux\u2019s usual piercing clarity, the book seems to unfold in a kind of suffocating twilight as the avenues pursued by the twenty-three-year-old Annie are shut off, one by one. A male friend whom she confides in invites her to dinner with his wife and child and then tries to seduce her. Doctors refuse to help. Annie desperately tries to find a friend of a friend rumored to know an abortionist. She is supposed to be working on her thesis, on female Surrealists, but she can focus only on her own female reality. \u201cIn a strange way, my inability to write my thesis was far more alarming than my need to abort,\u201d Ernaux writes. \u201cI had stopped being \u2018an intellectual.\u2019 I don\u2019t know whether this feeling is widespread. It causes indescribable pain.\u201d A different kind of pain follows a failed attempt to solve her problem with a pair of knitting needles. All the while, she feels \u201ctime flowing inside and outside of me\u201d\u2014the common calendar moving forward, her private one moving back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It has been speculated, fairly, that Ernaux\u2019s writing on abortion may be why the Nobel jury saw fit to award the prize to her this year, less than four months after Roe v. Wade was overturned. During her October visit to Barnard, Ernaux was asked, almost as if she were a politician, if she wished to say something to American women. She found it extraordinary, she replied, that the U.S., which had legalized abortion before France, should \u201creturn to savagery.\u201d This remark inspired applause. But \u201cHappening,\u201d when it was published, got a tepid response. \u201cIt was a book that bothered people,\u201d Ernaux told me. Aside from the events themselves, rendered with almost unbearably claustrophobic exactitude\u2014the abortion, and what happens afterward, is so brutal that even the film adaptation seems gentle by comparison\u2014there is Ernaux\u2019s total lack of guilt about what she did. There may be no parade, but for years she celebrated the night of the procedure \u201cas an anniversary.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the past few years, Ernaux told me, she has had the sense that she has fulfilled a certain trajectory. \u201cNo, not a trajectory. A destiny.\u201d She laughed, but she meant it. \u201cNot a destiny that was written from the beginning. One that was constructed, bit by bit, of course.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "One big reason for that is \u201cA Girl\u2019s Story,\u201d which Ernaux published in 2016. The book deals with the summer of 1958, when Ernaux, nearly eighteen, left home on her own for the first time, to work as a counsellor at a summer camp. On her third night there, she is selected by the twenty-two-year-old head counsellor for a tryst, though to put that word to their encounter would be to imply romance, or at least enjoyment. Annie is a protected only child of extreme social na\u00efvet\u00e9, a girl who \u201cdoes not know how to make a telephone call, has never taken a shower or bath,\u201d who feels herself free and on the verge of life, ready to escape home, have adventures, fall in love. Now she is laid down on a strange man\u2019s bed and watches as her body is used for his pleasure. But the experience is neither one of \u201chorror nor shame, only an obedience to what was happening.\u201d Far from seeing herself as a victim, she becomes slavishly devoted to the fact of her submission before this indifferent \u201cmaster.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That searing episode forms the kernel of the book. Around it, Ernaux builds a kind of detective story. The Annie from 1958 is a missing person. No photographs of her from that summer exist. The diaries she kept were burned by her mother. But Ernaux knows that the girl is still alive; she has been living inside her for decades. She is at the root of everything Ernaux has become as a woman and as a writer, and now she must be faced on her own terms."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There seemed something liberating in this, but Ernaux disagreed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI never considered writing to be a form of liberation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe image that I have is always of descending, of deepening something. And there isn\u2019t much freedom down there, not really. Often, when I speak with other writers\u2014with female writers, really\u2014the image we have of writing really varies. Some of them say that, for them, it\u2019s a way of going up toward something. But, for me, it\u2019s the absolute opposite. Not going underground, exactly. But into a well.\u201d What draws her down? An idea of some kind? No: \u201cAn obsession.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The image of the well brings to mind a rescue mission. Ernaux, so devoted to chronicling what she calls \u201cthe stupefaction of the real,\u201d has a mystical side, too. \u201cIt seems to me that I have finally freed the girl of \u201958, broken the spell that kept her prisoner for over fifty years,\u201d Ernaux writes of her younger self. This is triumphant, magical; it would make a wonderful ending. But it is not the end of the book, only its halfway point. All endings, in Ernaux\u2019s world, are temporary. The meaning of what she describes keeps shifting as time does. Critics will be tempted to refer to Ernaux\u2019s output, this fifty-year spelunking of the self, as an \u0153uvre, but she hates that word. \u201cAn \u2018\u0153uvre\u2019 is something that\u2019s closed,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd mine will be closed when I\u2019m dead.\u201d "}]}
