They lay the books on the ground and space them out precisely, forming a path. That image alone is enough to set forth the electric, often moving idea behind the play: that the arts we attend to\u2014literary, religious, choreographic, conversational\u2014are what, in the end, make us who we are and set us on our way. These books and their words are the substance of an unsettled soul, and have paved its road outward, into the world."}, {"role": "body", "text": "While the books are paraded, the performers call out the names of their authors: Allen Ginsberg, William Shakespeare, and Esmeralda Santiago are mentioned. (I glimpsed one of my own long-loved books, Santiago\u2019s \u201cWhen I Was Puerto Rican,\u201d just before it got placed on the ground.) \u201cWhere would I be without \u2018The House on Mango Street\u2019?\u201d somebody asks, referencing Sandra Cisneros\u2019s classic coming-of-age novel."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Cisneros\u2019s recent poem \u201cTea Dance, Provincetown, 1982,\u201d published in this magazine, she describes growing up\u2014her constant subject\u2014on the raucous, energetic dance floors of that summer resort town:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "We were all on the run in \u201982. Jumping to Laura Branigan\u2019s \u201cGloria,\u201d the summer\u2019s theme song. Beat thumping in our blood. Drinks sweeter than bodies convulsing on the floor."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Growing up, that poem posits, happens not alone but in concert, not as a private individual but as a being among beings in thrumming community, each person buffing a new facet of another\u2019s emerging identity. That\u2019s Hudes\u2019s ethos, too. Nobody\u2019s ever alone onstage."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMy Broken Language\u201d is adapted from Hudes\u2019s memoir of the same name, published last year. (Hudes won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, in 2012, for her play \u201cWater by the Spoonful,\u201d and wrote the book for Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s musical \u201cIn the Heights.\u201d) The play\u2019s text is, almost uniformly, a monologue with the texture of loving, lyrical prose. Five performers\u2014Zabryna Guevara, Yani Marin, Samora la Perdida, Marilyn Torres, and the always exciting Daphne Rubin-Vega, a longtime presence in Hudes\u2019s work\u2014take turns embodying the voice of the narrator, here called the Author. They move with a fluid grace through a green-tiled, houseplant-bedecked space, overhung with white ceiling fans, designed by Arnulfo Maldonado."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Hudes was raised in Philadelphia, surrounded by the Puerto Rican culture of her mother\u2019s family. While one actor pours forth Hudes\u2019s autobiographical material, often in the form of highly charged vignettes, describing social worlds and interior states in quick, compressed strokes, the others play members of her family: her mother or her coterie of revered older cousins."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Author is obviously Hudes, but what makes this an original play and not a regurgitated version of her memoir is the implication, realized in these bodies, that an autobiography is common property, not a house behind a fence. Others\u2019 real lives, their true personalities\u2014call them spirits\u2014shiver through us, leaving their mark. They make us dance and sing and mimic their speech. Why else can our friends \u201cdo\u201d us so well, developing physical and vocal impressions that flatter and mortify us with their emotional truth? Maybe that\u2019s why literature is so important to friendship: you read a book and so do I, and suddenly some region in both of our minds\u2014a way of talking, thinking, feeling\u2014becomes identical."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cMy Broken Language\u201d is structured in \u201cmovements,\u201d a nod to Hudes\u2019s musical background: she plays piano and studied music at Yale. Onstage with the actors, backing them up or marking space between their words, is a pianist, Ariacne Trujillo-Durand. The sections move forward in time, showing us new aspects of the Author\u2019s particular language. First comes a lovely portrait of Hudes\u2019s cousins, whom she calls the \u201cPerez women,\u201d describing them\u2014and, because their lives are all so powerfully intertwined, herself\u2014in the kind of detail that comes only by way of prolonged proximity:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Cuca, Tico, Flor, and Nuchi. Saying their names filled me with awe. They had babies and tats. I had blackheads and wedgies. They had curves and moves. I had puberty boobs called nipple-itis. They had acrylic tips in neon colors. I had piano lessons and nubby nails. They spoke Spanish like Greg Louganis dove\u2014twisting, flipping, explosive\u2014and laughed with the magnitude of a mushroom cloud."}, {"role": "body", "text": "There\u2019s a wistfulness in passages like this one, and throughout the play. It\u2019s the feeling of an artist looking back, surveying the fragmented landscape of her life, overlaying its confusions in retrospect, now armed with hard-won language. Hudes has a talent for describing the bodies of women. She writes with a rhythm and a tempo that match their curvature, and employs unlikely, often funny metaphors, ranging from pop culture to archeological and cosmic phenomena. Here she is, later on, now an M.F.A. student in playwriting at Brown, talking about the range of feminine figures she finds:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "After an El ride north through the desolate landscape, my matriarchs\u2019 bodies were natural wonders. Nuchi\u2019s eroded cheekbones were my Grand Canyon. Mom\u2019s thigh jiggles my Niagara Falls. The tattoo on Ginny\u2019s breast my Aurora Borealis. Facial moles like cacti in the sierra, front-tooth gaps like keyhole nebulae. The cellulite over their asses shone with a brook\u2019s babbling glimmer. The sag of each tit\u2014big ones and small\u2014like stalactites of epochal formation. Stalactitties!"}, {"role": "body", "text": "That early vignette about Hudes\u2019s cousins ends with the Author getting her period, that most personal and bodily marker of a young woman\u2019s passage into a new movement of her life\u2014an early digit in the \u201cthousand natural shocks\u201d that a girl\u2019s sensibilities become attuned to. Soon after that scene comes a different kind of rite: the Author witnesses her mother, an initiate into the Yoruba priesthood, being possessed by a spirit. The Author\u2019s voice, moving among bodies, is a kind of possession, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Her mother\u2019s religion, unsanctioned and all but unknown in the American mainstream, makes Hudes aware that she lives her life across spheres, across languages, across oceans. This might be the deep source of Hudes\u2019s facility with figurative language, fired by unexpected comparisons: all her life, the play seems to say, she has been drawing connections between seemingly unlike things. Her own unique English\u2014musical, repetitive, intense\u2014is a syncretistic stew. She realizes how her mother\u2019s ceremony and her cousins\u2019 dancing are really one thing:"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "How propulsive and insistent their hips were, as if conducted by some magnificent force. Those gatherings were secular, this one was spiritual. And yet, a pulse is a pulse is a pulse. A drum is a drum is a drum. Yes, it was true, and here lay the evidence: dance and possession were dialects off the same mother tongue. I spoke neither. English, my best language, had no vocabulary for the possession nor the dance. And English was what I was made of. Would my words and my world ever align?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The answer, made evident in this play, is yes. \u201cMy Broken Language\u201d is the product and the proof of a long process. Watching it and listening to it, my thoughts often strayed toward genre. After all, this is essentially a personal essay acted out. But the complications that so often come with personal writing\u2014self-obsession, claustrophobic enclosure, a certain stubborn myopia\u2014are nowhere in evidence. Sure, there are places where the Author\u2019s voice goes mawkish and her prose crosses that often untraceable line between lyricism and purpleness. But probing, intelligent, earnest voices\u2014the kind we hear when we close our eyes and think of life\u2014sometimes tend that way, too."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As the actors tossed the Author\u2019s voice around, each excavating a new aspect of its appeal, I kept hoping that the production would hint at a way forward for personal essayists and other writers growing tired of their own interior monologues. Maybe they could put them up onstage and divide them among bodies and see what happens when they bounce off the walls."}]}
