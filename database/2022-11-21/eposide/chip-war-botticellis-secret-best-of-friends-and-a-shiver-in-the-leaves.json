In 1882, an Austro-Hungarian art collector purchased a set of drawings by Sandro Botticelli that had been languishing in private collections in France and England for centuries. In this wide-ranging history, Luzzi considers why the drawings, which illustrated eighty-eight cantos of Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy, had fallen into oblivion, and charts both Dante\u2019s and Botticelli\u2019s reputations across the ages. Many early critics found Botticelli\u2019s drawings out of step with Dante\u2019s text, arguing that the Renaissance artist\u2019s sensual, full-bodied humans undermined the medieval poet\u2019s \u201cvisceral yearning for God.\u201d Luzzi, by contrast, reads Botticelli\u2019s drawings as \u201ca \u2018poem\u2019 in their own regard,\u201d and as a crucial link in the \u201cmapping of the human spirit\u2019s transition\u201d from one era to the next."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/636a923497477f56961c32c2/master/w_1600,c_limit/221121_r41376web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Best of Friends, by Kamila Shamsie (Riverhead). This novel begins in Karachi, in the nineteen-eighties, where the optimism of two privileged teen-age girls is punctured when they are abducted by a friend\u2019s driver, an event that forces them to confront their powerlessness in a world dominated by men. Their friendship persists, in diminished form, as the novel leaps into present-day London, where the two work on opposite sides of Britain\u2019s political divide: one as a venture capitalist and the other as a civil-rights campaigner. The pair\u2019s frayed bond is tested when their abductor reappears to seek the latter\u2019s help.

Brutality and tenderness intertwine in this collection, which illuminates the inner life of a young gay Black man navigating desire, depression, family, and faith. Although the poems are haunted by historical and contemporary violence, they are also often rapturous, revelling in the pleasures of nature and of the body. Hughes\u2019s primary mode is almost Romantic, aware of death\u2019s ubiquitous presence, yet alive with feeling; allusions to Dickinson, Emerson, and Poe abound. For all there is to mourn, kinship provides a kind of compass. \u201cI have wanted / nothing / to do with blackness / or laughter / or my life,\u201d Hughes writes. \u201cBut, about love, / who owns the right, / really?\u201d"}]}
