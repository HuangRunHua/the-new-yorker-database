He was nineteen, with an athlete\u2019s body and a sunny, symmetrical face. The next-youngest adult in the group was fifty-seven. Then, as now, rearing tiny trees in ornamental pots was not commonly considered a young man\u2019s hobby."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Neil had grown up in a small Colorado mountain town. For much of his youth, he was focussed on playing sports, especially basketball, which he approached with an almost clinical rigor: during high-school summer breaks, he\u2019d wake up every day at five-thirty and attempt twelve hundred jump shots before going to the gym to lift weights. By his junior year, he was the best player on the team. By his senior year, he had torn one of his quadriceps\u2014\u201cIt was hanging on by just a thread,\u201d he recalls\u2014and was looking for a new obsession."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Like many Americans of his generation, Neil had discovered bonsai through the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d films. He was especially fond of the third movie in the series, which features dreamy shots of characters rappelling down a cliff face to collect a miniature juniper. In the films, the wise karate instructor, Mr. Miyagi, practices the art of bonsai, and in Neil\u2019s young mind it came to represent a romantic ideal: the pursuit of perfection through calm discipline. One day, after seeing bonsai for sale at a local fair, he rode his bike to the library, checked out every book on bonsai, and lugged them all home."}, {"role": "body", "text": "About a month later, he got his hands on a trade magazine, Bonsai Today, which featured an article about Masahiko Kimura, the so-called magician of bonsai, who is regarded by many enthusiasts as the field\u2019s most innovative living figure. (Kunio Kobayashi, one of Kimura\u2019s chief rivals at the time, called him \u201cthe kind of genius who comes along once every hundred years, or maybe more.\u201d) The article described how Kimura had transformed and refined a small juniper tree that had been collected in the wild. A scruffy, shapeless plant had become a cantilevered sculpture. As Neil saw it, Kimura had given the tree not just a new shape but a soul."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Near the end of high school, Neil laid out a meticulous long-term plan that would culminate in his travelling across the Pacific to apprentice under Kimura, who was considered the toughest bonsai master in Japan. Neil knew that the work would not be easy. Bonsai apprenticeships could last anywhere between five and ten years. At the time, some fifty people had begun working under Kimura, but only five had completed the apprenticeship, all of them Japanese."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Neil went to college at California Polytechnic State University, in San Luis Obispo, where he majored in horticulture and studied Japanese. He helped take care of the university\u2019s bonsai collection and travelled around the West Coast to attend master classes with renowned practitioners. While other students were partying, he stayed home looking at bonsai blogs, or drove his pickup truck to remote mountain locations in search of wild miniature trees. \u201cHe was possessed,\u201d his father recalls."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Neil signed up for the tour of Japan during his sophomore year, and took a short leave from school. On the second day of the trip, the group visited Kimura\u2019s garden, in a rural area some thirty miles northwest of Tokyo. It was a cool, gray morning; Neil wore a hoodie. The group was met by one of Kimura\u2019s apprentices and ushered past rows of ancient and pristinely shaped bonsai into the back garden\u2014the workshop\u2014where few visitors were allowed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Neil later likened the moment to peering into the mind of a mad genius. Hundreds of knee-high trees, in various states of arboreal surgery, were lined up on benches and beer crates. Custom-made power tools were scattered around the workshop, including a machine, used to sculpt trunks, that shot out tiny glass beads. Kimura was famed for his deft use of these devices to carve rippling torrents of shari\u2014bone-white deadwood that is laced with thin veins of living wood."}, {"role": "body", "text": "That day, Kimura, who was then in his sixties, was working on an Ezo spruce with a spiky, half-dead trunk which was estimated to be a thousand years old. A photographer from the Japanese magazine Kindai Bonsai was present to document the process. Neil and the other visitors observed as Kimura, with the help of his lead apprentice, Taiga Urushibata, used guy wires and a piece of rebar to bend the trunk downward, compressing the tree\u2014an act requiring a phenomenal balance of strength and finesse. Kimura misted the branches with water and wrapped them with thick copper wire. He then bent the branches\u2014some slightly upward, some downward\u2014arranging the foliage into an imperfect dome, with small windows of light spaced throughout the greenery. He worked with relentless focus, but what amazed Neil most was the synchronicity of Kimura and Urushibata: whenever Kimura needed a tool, he would wordlessly extend his hand, and Urushibata would have the implement waiting for him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After Kimura had made his design decisions, he left Urushibata to finish wiring the branches.

This has been known since at least the Tang dynasty in China, circa 700 a.d. One method was to plant a seedling in a dried orange peel and trim any roots that poked through. With a smaller root base, the tree cannot find the necessary nutrients to shoot upward, and thus remains small. In certain environments, like rocky cliffsides, this can occur naturally. The artistry, then, lies in shaping the tree. For most bonsai practitioners, \u201cstyling\u201d a tree is a question of which branches to cut off and how to bend those which remain, using metal wire, so that the plant\u2019s over-all form elicits a feeling of something ancient and wild. The usual aim is not to imitate the profile of big trees\u2014which are considered too messy to be beautiful\u2014but to intensely evoke them. In culinary terms, bonsai is bouillon."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the 1990 book \u201cThe World in Miniature,\u201d the Sinologist Rolf Stein notes that a range of early Taoist practices focussed on the magical power of tiny things.

These spaces provided a form of virtual travel, not unlike how books function for us today."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taoism had a special reverence for fantastically gnarled trees, which, because their lumber is useless to woodcutters and carpenters, are often spared the axe, enduring for centuries. This aged look was incorporated into the aesthetic of miniaturized trees; after all, there is nothing magical about a tiny young tree."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The vogue for miniature gardens spread throughout China, and then, around the thirteenth century, to Japan. As Japan urbanized\u2014by 1700, Tokyo, then known as Edo, was home to a million people, nearly twice the population of London\u2014the miniaturization of nature gradually came to serve a more practical purpose: it allowed people to go outdoors without leaving their homes."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As the bonsai historian Hideo Marushima has noted, \u201cThe keeping of potted plants is not often a matter of public record,\u201d making it difficult to trace the development of the bonsai form. But we do know, from historical woodblock prints of bonsai, that early artists favored twisty trunks and tufty foliage. Changes in fashion tended to hinge on particular species rather than on pruning styles: a fad for azaleas was followed by one for smooth-barked maples, then one for mandarin-orange trees. A craze for wild Ishizuchi shimpaku junipers caused their near-extinction."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In the early twentieth century, the widespread adoption of copper wire, which allowed artists to perform increasingly precise manipulations, led to more extreme stylization: some bonsai leaned far to one side, as if buffeted by harsh winds; some stood ramrod straight; some spilled over the side of the pot, as if cascading down a cliff; some resembled the sinuous ink stroke of a calligrapher. It could take decades, or longer, to create a trunk with the desired silhouette. Patience, care, and an invisibly light touch were the hallmarks of a bonsai master."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kimura is sometimes said to have done for bonsai what Picasso did for painting\u2014he shattered the art form and then re\u00ebngineered it. Using power tools, he performed transformations so drastic that the resulting shapes seemed almost impossible. Moreover, his new methods allowed him to execute dramatic alterations in hours as opposed to over decades. Not surprisingly, his accelerated technique was admired and imitated throughout the West."}, {"role": "body", "text": "When Neil spoke of his desire to apprentice with Kimura, many American bonsai enthusiasts warned him that Kimura was harsh, uncouth, even cruel. But Neil wasn\u2019t easily intimidated, and he was dazzled by what he had seen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He flew back home and resumed college. After enlisting a tutor in Japanese, he wrote a rudimentary letter to Kimura asking to become his apprentice. Kimura did not respond. So Neil wrote another letter, and, when that was also met with silence, another, and another. Writing each month, he sent some twenty letters without hearing back."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Shortly after Neil graduated, though, he received an elegantly handwritten note from Kimura. He was elated to learn that his request had been granted. Kimura wrote, \u201cTraining is of course about acquiring skills, but total apprehension of the spiritual aspect is of the utmost importance. It may be strict, but, if you dedicate yourself fully, it will most certainly be rewarding.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Masahiko Kimura was eleven years old when his father, a successful engineer, died suddenly. The family fell into poverty, and Kimura was forced to get a job as an errand boy. Life became \u201chell,\u201d he has said. It was 1951, and Japan was still recovering from the Second World War. College was out of reach. When he was fifteen, his mother announced that she was sending him to apprentice at T\u014dju-En, a famous bonsai garden in the Tokyo suburb of \u014cmiya. It was the epicenter of the art form. She had noticed that he was good with his hands, and she wanted to give him a profession with a stable income."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For the next three years, Kimura worked seven days a week, from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., without a single day off. His master at T\u014dju-En, Motosuke Hamano, harshly corrected his every error; Kimura says that his master even instructed him in how to walk. Kimura was given five minutes to finish meals. He was allowed no girlfriends, no alcohol, and no cigarettes. At night, he practiced the guitar and dreamed of being a rock star."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kimura completed his apprenticeship when he was twenty-six. Lacking the money to open a bonsai garden of his own, he instead started a plant shop. It was successful, and, after a decade or so, he had saved enough money to become a professional bonsai artist. Now married with two daughters, he was determined to catch up to his more privileged contemporaries. One day, after he\u2019d spent seven hours shaping a shimpaku juniper, a thought occurred to him: Why doesn\u2019t anyone use power tools to accomplish this more quickly?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Around this time, a thirty-year-old engineer working at Toyota named Takeo Kawabe visited Kimura\u2019s bonsai garden, fell in love with the trees, and asked to become his apprentice. Together, they developed an arsenal of custom devices\u2014sandblasters, small chainsaws, grinders\u2014that made it easy to quickly shape deadwood into whorls and wisps. Using power tools, Kimura could hollow out thick roots, allowing him to coil them up in smaller pots; he could also bend stout trees, to make them appear smaller, or split them apart, to create forest-style plantings. Michael Hagedorn, an American bonsai artist who apprenticed in Japan, said of these advances, \u201cIt\u2019s similar to electrifying a guitar\u2014the possibilities just go 3-D.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Because Kimura\u2019s shop could work faster, cheaper, and better than those of his competitors, his business flourished.

(In the nineteen-eighties, at the peak of Japan\u2019s economic boom, a brilliantly styled yamadori might sell for more than a million dollars.)

Kimura\u2019s work, which is monumental by bonsai standards\u2014some trees reached as high as my sternum, with trunks nearly as wide as my waist\u2014was well suited to this trend, and he had profited greatly from it.
