Around him were four instruments housed at the university\u2019s music department, representing stages in keyboard development from the seventeenth century to the mid-nineteenth. On one side was a harpsichord, of the kind that Bach might have played. In the middle were two fortepianos\u2014early-stage pianos with a light action and a crisp, characterful sound. Behind them was an 1854 grand piano, from the illustrious firm of \u00c9rard. Modern grands are well-tooled machines, fairly predictable in their behavior, even if virtuosos fuss over them and badger technicians with requests for adjustments. Older pianos, with their variegated mechanisms and idiosyncratic construction, are far more temperamental. To present a program on four different historical instruments\u2014as Bezuidenhout was going to do later that day, in a recital for the Berkeley series Cal Performances\u2014is to invite chaos."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThese older instruments, and even the modern copies, function so differently in rehearsal and in concert,\u201d Bezuidenhout told me. \u201cSometimes you have this feeling in rehearsal: \u2018Oh, yes, this is really making sense, the piano is really helping me.\u2019 Then, in concert, they kind of turn on you. The five-octave pianos, especially, can betray you, leave you in the dust. You say to yourself, \u2018Where is that sound I heard four hours ago?\u2019 It may have to do with a change of humidity, or a way of reacting to the room. But it\u2019s as if they can sense your level of stress, your preoccupation, and then they seize up\u2014like some kind of really mean cat.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The \u00c9rard piano was being particularly skittish. With a seven-octave range and an eight-foot frame, it looked like a modern piano, but it was not acting like one. Bezuidenhout played some chords in the octave below middle C. \u201cDown here, it sounds so lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as you go up higher\u201d\u2014he ventured an octave above middle C\u2014\u201cit gets impossibly bright.\u201d The timbre was curiously strident and unpleasant. Bezuidenhout tried shutting the piano lid, so that the soundboard was completely enclosed. He played a few more chords, then shook his head."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bezuidenhout later conferred with Jeremy Geffen, the executive and artistic director of Cal Performances. Geffen, a veteran administrator who worked for many years at Carnegie Hall, told the keyboardist simply to ignore the \u00c9rard if he didn\u2019t respond to it. Fortunately, Bezuidenhout was finding more of a rapport with the larger of the two fortepianos\u2014a copy of a Viennese Graf instrument from the eighteen-twenties. He decided to shift his program so that most of it would be divided between the fortepianos."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cSometimes you ask yourself why the hell you are doing this,\u201d Bezuidenhout told me. \u201cBut the need to adapt to changing circumstances is what makes it interesting. And there are times when the stars do align, when it\u2019s as if the camera has been perfectly set up, and it\u2019s the most beautiful thing you\u2019ve heard in your life. It\u2019s really worth it for those moments.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bezuidenhout, a forty-three-year-old musician who was born in South Africa and spent much of his youth in Australia, fell in love with period instruments at an early age, when he began listening to Mozart recordings by the pianist Malcolm Bilson and the conductor John Eliot Gardiner. \u201cThe character and energy of the music-making, the level of detail, the freshness\u2014I\u2019d never heard Mozart played like that before,\u201d he told me. He later had lessons with Bilson at the Eastman School of Music and made a specialty of the fortepiano."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI remember working on Mozart\u2019s F-Major Sonata, K. 332,\u201d Bezuidenhout went on. \u201cWhen you play Mozart on a modern piano, everyone is always talking about grazioso, elegant phrasing, \u2018Mozart style.\u2019 Scale it down, be careful not to overwhelm the music. On the fortepiano, it\u2019s the opposite: you\u2019ve got to push, you\u2019ve got to play as if your life depended on it. Automatically, the music takes on a completely different character: instead of restraint, there\u2019s a wonderful feeling of letting go. And with the direct action of these little hammers on the strings, with the natural decay in the mechanism, there\u2019s suddenly a lot more space between the notes. That instantly changed what Mozart meant to me.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Between 2009 and 2014, Bezuidenhout recorded a nine-volume cycle of Mozart\u2019s keyboard music, for the Harmonia Mundi label. He used modern copies of Anton Walter five-octave fortepianos, from Mozart\u2019s time. Bilson, Paul Badura-Skoda, and Ronald Brautigam, among others, had undertaken similar projects; a vigorous survey by the pianist-scholar Robert Levin is now available on the ECM label. But I prize Bezuidenhout\u2019s interpretations for their tonal variety, their richness of phrasing, their sense of fantasy. His Mozart is beautiful without ever being pretty\u2014the fortepiano\u2019s innate pungency makes sure of that."}, {"role": "body", "text": "More recently, Bezuidenhout has recorded the Beethoven concertos on fortepiano, working alongside Pablo Heras-Casado and the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra. \u201cWith Beethoven, there\u2019s a feeling of the instrument starting to buckle under the pressure, as if you\u2019re in an airplane in a stretch of severe turbulence,\u201d Bezuidenhout told me. \u201cMozart never pushes to that extent\u2014he\u2019s kind, he\u2019s mindful of human and mechanical limitations. Beethoven doesn\u2019t care, and that\u2019s actually rather exciting.\u201d Hearing this most familiar of composers on a fortepiano restores the shock of his advance; on a modern instrument, he is always a little bit tamed."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bezuidenhout began his Berkeley recital at the harpsichord, playing Bach\u2019s Toccata in D Minor. He then moved to the smaller fortepiano\u2014a five-octave model made by Rodney Regier, in imitation of Walter\u2014and launched into Mozart\u2019s Fantasia in C Minor. The timbral shift was notable: Mozart probably would not have devised the spare, gnomic opening utterances of the Fantasia on the harpsichord, where sound dies quickly and continuous activity is paramount. Bezuidenhout stayed at the Walter for Beethoven\u2019s \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d; his account had a startling ferocity, with fortissimos landing like gut punches."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The Graf-style fortepiano, a six-and-a-half-octave instrument with considerable carrying power, was the sweetheart of this keyboard litter. It, too, came from Regier, who fashions fortepianos in a barn in Freeport, Maine. Bezuidenhout began by offering two pieces by Schubert: the Andantino from \u201cMoments Musicaux\u201d and the slow movement from the Sonata in A Minor, D. 537. The timbres that emerged were thoroughly bewitching: an F-sharp-minor arpeggio figure in the Andantino sounded as if it were being played by a cello and a bassoon in unison. Bezuidenhout deepened the otherworldly atmosphere by making use of a moderator pedal, which causes a strip of cloth to be inserted between the hammers and the strings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Bezuidenhout stayed at the Graf for a smattering of Mendelssohn: six of his \u201cSongs Without Words\u201d and his Three Fantasies or Caprices, Op. 16. With the fortepiano\u2019s tang and grit, these pieces came across more as miniature tone poems than as salon confections. Only for the final item on the program\u2014Clara Schumann\u2019s Romance in A Minor\u2014did Bezuidenhout move to the forlorn \u00c9rard. Partway through the piece, he got up and returned to the Graf, eliciting a contented sigh from the audience."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Some didacts of the early-music world would maintain that certain composers must be performed on so-called original instruments. Bezuidenhout, in remarks from the stage at Hertz, distanced himself from the charged word \u201cauthentic,\u201d describing his work as \u201chistorically inspired.\u201d For me, the experience of hearing a broad range of repertory filtered through instruments of various eras had the effect of freeing the composers from the tyranny of norms. This recital captured, above all, a sense of music as an evolutionary art, reacting to technology in flux and history in motion."}]}
