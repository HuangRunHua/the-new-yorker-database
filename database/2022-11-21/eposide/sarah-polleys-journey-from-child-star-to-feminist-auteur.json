Polley had become famous as a child actor\u2014by her early teens, she was a household name in her native Canada, starring in \u201cRoad to Avonlea,\u201d a nostalgic television series inspired by the beloved children\u2019s books of L. M. Montgomery. In 1995, a year after she left that show, she was asked out by Jian Ghomeshi, a CBC radio broadcaster and a well-known Canadian cultural figure a dozen years her senior. They went on a date and returned to his apartment, where he played her songs recorded by Moxy Fr\u00fcvous, a satirical folk-pop band that he had co-founded. So far, so cringey. He kissed her, then informed her that he was into \u201cpretty weird stuff.\u201d Polley, who is slight of build, with a quick, exuberant laugh, would finish her tale by describing how Ghomeshi had run his hands all over her still-clothed body at speed, while repeating a peculiar incantation: \u201cYou\u2019re in Hell! There\u2019s Devil hands all over your body!\u201d The encounter that followed, Polley told her amused, appalled listeners, put her off one-night stands forever."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2014, the Toronto Star published an article in which three women gave accounts of having been choked, hit, or otherwise physically hurt by Ghomeshi\u2014allegations at odds with his progressive reputation. In a preview of what later became the #MeToo movement, Ghomeshi was fired by the CBC, and more than a dozen additional women came forward with similar accusations. He was charged with four counts of sexual assault, and one of overcoming resistance to choking. As Polley discussed the news reports with family and friends, she started recalling things that she\u2019d left out of her worst-date anecdote\u2014how the Devil-hands foreplay had progressed into something more upsetting and overwhelming, with Ghomeshi placing his hands around her neck and leaving them there."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Polley weighed whether to support Ghomeshi\u2019s accusers by sharing her own story, the memory of which she was still piecing together. She was wary. Relatives and lawyer friends advised her that although they believed her account, others might not. She and Ghomeshi had remained in touch, exchanging chatty e-mails; in 2012, she\u2019d appeared on his radio show, and had laughed ingratiatingly at his comments\u2014flirted with him, even. A jury, she was warned, might judge her rather than him."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Polley, who\u2019d just given birth to her second child, stayed silent.

In a chapter titled \u201cThe Woman Who Stayed Silent,\u201d Polley gives a forensic account of the ways in which her credibility could have been undermined, had she told her story; among other things, she had recounted her worst-date anecdote to friends who worked for the law firm that represented Ghomeshi. She describes how the traumatized mind can repress or reformulate an unwelcome experience, and indicts the inflexibility of a legal system that\u2014in its valid efforts to insure that innocent people are not wrongfully punished\u2014often inflicts harm on women who come forward with an accusation. \u201cI believe those women because the erratic way they behaved later, the inconsistencies in their stories, the gaps in their memories, all reminded me of my own behaviour, my own memory,\u201d she writes. \u201cFor me, those inconsistencies were as much evidence that they were victims of sexual assault as it was for others that they hadn\u2019t been.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "The aftermath of sexual assault\u2014how to prosecute it, or process it, or avenge it, or live with it, or even forgive it\u2014is the subject of Polley\u2019s new film, \u201cWomen Talking,\u201d which she adapted from a novel of the same name by the Canadian writer Miriam Toews. The book was inspired by a true-life horror story that occurred about fifteen years ago in a Mennonite colony in rural Bolivia, in which male members of the community systematically raped dozens of girls and women. The men broke into their houses and sedated them with a tranquillizer formulated for cows. The victims\u2014one of them only three years old\u2014woke up bloodied and bruised, with a feeling of having been assaulted by an unplaceable presence. It took four years for the perpetrators to be exposed; until then, some people in the colony claimed that demons were responsible for the attacks."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Both Toews\u2019s novel and Polley\u2019s film imagine a fictional reckoning: the women in this tight-knit, patriarchal, fundamentalist, pacifist community urgently discuss how best to respond to the abuse, narrowing the choices to three options\u2014do nothing, stay and fight, or leave. The novel is narrated by August Epp, a gentle schoolteacher and the only man trusted by the women, who are illiterate, to serve as the scribe of their meetings. Unlike Toews, who is Mennonite, Polley has no personal connection with the denomination, though she told me, when we met in Toronto in September, that she has long been fascinated with its ethics. \u201cI\u2019ve always been really drawn to the collectivity and selflessness of those communities,\u201d she said. The first serious work of art she bought, nearly twenty years ago, was a print by the Canadian photographer Larry Towell, whose black-and-white images of life in Mennonite colonies were an inspiration for the film\u2019s desaturated palette. Towell\u2019s work also helped Polley visualize the movie\u2019s locations\u2014chief among them a hayloft where the women debate their options\u2014and informed her sympathetic depiction of communal devotion. Polley told me, \u201cI think we can have a lot of judgment about hierarchical structures of power, and how they can lead to things like this. But in terms of the way the women experience their faith, and what it means to them\u2014I wasn\u2019t interested in judging that.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Befitting the film\u2019s title, Polley\u2019s script is quite talky; whereas a more conventional artist might have hewed as closely as possible to Toews\u2019s story, she has stripped some of it away, distilling it into a heady movie of ideas, in which the arguments have not just life-and-death implications but also life-and-afterlife ones: Is revenge justified, or is it a mortal sin? These conversations are made all the more powerful by a commanding ensemble of actors. Rooney Mara plays Ona, who has been impregnated by one of the unknown rapists and maintains an otherworldly equanimity as she weighs questions of justice. Claire Foy is Ona\u2019s sister, Salome, who threatens to kill the men who have raped her four-year-old daughter. Jessie Buckley plays Mariche, whose husband doesn\u2019t bother to use cow tranquillizer before battering her and their sixteen-year-old daughter, Autje.

Over the past few years, a real language has developed around some of these things, giving people a frame. You see people becoming conscious of things that have harmed them\u2014that they knew harmed them on some level, but that they didn\u2019t necessarily have the language for.

The subject matter of that film, in which a long-married couple, played by Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent, contend with the onset of the wife\u2019s dementia, was unexpected for a twenty-seven-year-old director. But the film had an unusual emotional maturity, delicately capturing Christie\u2019s quivering efforts to maintain her self-possession. It earned Academy Award nominations for both Polley and Christie. Polley\u2019s follow-up, \u201cTake This Waltz\u201d (2011), explored less surprising territory. Michelle Williams played Margot, a young journalist restless in her marriage to Lou, a cookbook writer played by Seth Rogen, and tempted by an artist neighbor, played with erotic panache by Luke Kirby. The film was not merely about a love triangle: it offered a subtle exploration of early-adult lostness and a persuasive depiction of female desire."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I first met Polley in 2011, when \u201cTake This Waltz\u201d premi\u00e8red at the Toronto Film Festival. Over dinner, we spoke for a long time about love, marriage, and family: she had just married David Sandomierski, a doctoral student in law, who is now a professor at Western University, in London, Ontario. (It was Polley\u2019s second marriage; in her twenties, she had briefly been married to David Wharnsby, who had also been her film editor.) We talked about her career as an actress, and her early swerve away from Hollywood and mainstream fare in favor of Canada and independent cinema. (At twenty, she was cast in a lead role in Cameron Crowe\u2019s \u201cAlmost Famous,\u201d as a groupie; she got as far as a hotel room in Los Angeles, waiting for rehearsals to begin, before she bailed out. It became Kate Hudson\u2019s breakthrough role instead.) She talked about losing her mother to cancer when she was eleven, and about being given a childhood diagnosis of scoliosis: she\u2019d had to wear a cumbersome brace underneath her period costume for \u201cAvonlea,\u201d and underwent surgery in her mid-teens. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a good sob story,\u201d she said, sardonically. \u201cEverybody says, \u2018Oh, life was so much better when I was a kid.\u2019 But my life was pretty crappy at that age, so I feel like life now is amazing.\u201d Polley was articulate, funny, and frank.

The resulting picture, \u201cStories We Tell,\u201d came out in 2012. In it, Polley investigated a long-standing family joke among her four much older siblings\u2014namely, that she was not the biological child of the man who raised her. The movie drew a multifaceted portrait of her mother, Diane Polley, a vivacious actress and casting director whose premature death cast a shadow over Polley\u2019s family. Polley interviewed her siblings; her father, the actor Michael Polley; and the man who she discovered was her biological father, Harry Gulkin, a well-known Canadian film producer with whom Diane had had an affair. In an inspired and unsettling fabrication, Polley cast actors to play Diane, Michael, and Harry in scenes that, on first viewing, appeared to be home movies, shot decades earlier. Memories, the film suggests, are themselves a slippery kind of fiction\u2014a rendering of the past reshaped by our present emotional needs. \u201cStories We Tell\u201d secured for Polley a wreath of prizes, and confirmed her gift for combining compassionate intelligence with steely artistic conviction."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/636d7dbf6e8bb583410b7584/master/w_1600,c_limit/221121_a27149.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1279, "imageDescription": "\u201cMaybe if you stopped calling us \u2018little pigs\u2019 we\u2019d let you in.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Though Polley\u2019s first three films are ostensibly disparate in subject matter, they all plumb themes of loss and repair.
