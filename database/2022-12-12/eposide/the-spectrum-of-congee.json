A more surprising place to find it is in brownstone Brooklyn. In 2017, Layla Chen took over the sandwich shop Bed-Stuy Provisions and slowly transformed it into Maya Congee Caf\u00e9 (563 Gates Ave.), named for her now five-year-old daughter. Chen had initially wanted to offer grits, her favorite thing to order at the beloved, now shuttered Bed-Stuy bakery Scratchbread. But when she hired Scratchbread\u2019s proprietor, Matthew Tilden, as a consultant, he suggested leaning into her roots. When Chen was seven, her family moved from Guangdong to Hawaii, where her dad opened a Chinese food-court counter."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/638932d74d4403fc45f9135e/master/w_1600,c_limit/221212_r41526.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1066, "imageDescription": "The Wake Me Up congee includes smoked cheese, a soft-boiled egg, spicy shredded pork, avocado, and fried shallots."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Chen\u2019s parents made congee when she was growing up, and, indeed, she ate congee in the weeks after Maya was born.

Cooked in water seasoned with bay leaves, it happens to be vegan, and it\u2019s easy to keep it as such, even with plenty of toppings: roasted peanuts, avocado, shaved broccoli, Chen\u2019s superlative salsa (ginger, turmeric, jalape\u00f1o, and garlic), crispy shallots out of giant tubs imported from Vietnam\u2014which are available for purchase among the caf\u00e9\u2019s pantry items."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Omnivores can choose from a range of proteins, including braised chicken (the leftover braising liquid is mixed with the salsa for a rich, fortifying soup); spicy shredded pork; a house-made smoked-cheese blend; a soft-boiled hen egg or a tangy preserved duck egg, whose whites have gone black and glossy; and a surprisingly successful dollop of smoked whitefish salad.

Moreover, Congee Village, which expanded to Flushing (36-36 Prince St.) in 2016, has opened another location in Manhattan (207 Bowery), in August. On a recent afternoon, I popped in for a clay pot of sampan congee, named for the small boats that cruise the Pearl River in Guangdong, whose operators sell the porridge laced with a mix of meat and seafood. My congee\u2014made with only white rice, loose and silky\u2014was topped with cilantro and peanuts. Within its steamy depths, I found delicate curls of squid tentacle, sliced fish cake, pork rinds, and ribbons of roasted pig skin. I added splashes of thick soy sauce, spoonfuls of chili oil, and segments of you tiao, twists of fried dough served at breakfast in China, and felt thoroughly nourished by the spectrum of congee. (Maya Congee Caf\u00e9 congee bowls $10-$15; Congee Village congee $4.95-$12.95.)"}]}
