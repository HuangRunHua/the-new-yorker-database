This biography of a cult writer and pioneer of queer fiction tries to reconcile mainstream neglect of his work with the acclaim he received from authors including Tennessee Williams and Susan Sontag. Purdy, who once insisted that \u201call of my work is a criticism of the United States,\u201d specialized in a kind of \u201coutlaw fiction.\u201d His treatment of \u201cpassing\u201d and his use of Black vernacular made Langston Hughes assume that he was Black. Snyder takes us from Purdy\u2019s childhood on an Ohio farm to his final years in New York, in a tantalizing portrait of a man with a talent for alienating colleagues, but also for conveying \u201ca tragic sense of life couched in dark laughter.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/638646b2a0e213bfa02f0411/master/w_1600,c_limit/221212_r41507web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Beyond Measure, by James Vincent (Norton). This book uses a seemingly simple question\u2014How did our units of measurement originate?\u2014to deliver a profound reflection on how we experience and describe the world. The author\u2019s inquiry takes him from Cairo, where he visits a thousand-year-old device for measuring the Nile\u2019s floodwaters, to an iron cabinet in Paris that houses the standard metre and kilogram produced after the French Revolution. If measurement constitutes, as Vincent believes, \u201ca mirror to society itself,\u201d then it is perhaps no surprise that its history is one of both ingenuity and oppression. Ultimately, Vincent writes, our \u201cframeworks of order that seem inviolable because of their deep roots in tradition and authority are as changeable as anything else in life.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/638646b2aa8105337f610eb0/master/w_1600,c_limit/221212_r41508web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Cocoon, by Zhang Yueran, translated from the Chinese by Jeremy Tiang (World Editions). In this multilayered novel about the sins and traumas of China\u2019s past, two childhood friends reunite in their provincial home town after years apart. In the course of a winter night, their alternating monologues sift through their family histories, circling a fateful moment during the Cultural Revolution which left one man\u2019s grandfather comatose and set the other\u2019s up for an eminent medical career. As the two friends\u2019 fortunes become increasingly intertwined, they also trade stories of their childhoods in the eighties, and the historical weight shouldered by their generation. \u201cBlood ties are a form of violence, the way they yoke together people who feel nothing for each other,\u201d Zhang writes."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/638646b27fbfe441c60937d2/master/w_1600,c_limit/221212_r41509web.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Everything the Light Touches, by Janice Pariat (HarperVia). Four characters embark on journeys that bring them into close communion with nature, in this philosophical novel. A young Indian woman finds a sense of purpose in her country\u2019s rural east. In the Edwardian era, an English botanist journeys to the same remote area, searching for a mythical tree. Carl Linnaeus, the father of biological classification, travels through Lapland, and Goethe develops his framework for perceiving the unity of a natural world in which \u201call is leaf.\u201d Goethe\u2019s rejection of the scientific wish to define nature and the mercantile one to extract value from it provides the book\u2019s intellectual core.
