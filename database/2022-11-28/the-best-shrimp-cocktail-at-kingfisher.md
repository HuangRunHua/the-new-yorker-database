You might describe my relationship with shrimp cocktail as delusional. If it’s on a menu, I order it. It’s almost always unexceptional, and yet I’m compelled by its raw-bar glamour, and by the slimmest chance of greatness. One night in the summer of 2021, this high-stakes calculation paid off like never before. I ordered shrimp cocktail at, of all places, a breakfast-taco window, called Mockingbird, briefly home to a pop-up oyster bar. It was the best iteration I’d ever had—the sweetness of the plump, chilled meat drawn out with salt (why is shrimp cocktail so often undersalted?) and lemon zest (a revelation), served with shaved horseradish and a fruity but balanced cocktail sauce.

I’m delighted to report that the shrimp cocktail of my dreams has signed a lease. Last month, in Prospect Lefferts Gardens, André Hueston Mack and Phoebe Damrosch, a married couple who met working at Per Se (he was a sommelier, she a server), opened Kingfisher. It’s the latest addition to their growing neighborhood empire, which, along with Mockingbird, also includes & Sons Ham Bar and Buttery, a restaurant and shop specializing in domestic cured meats and cheeses; a wine store called VyneYard (Mack has his own label); and a bakery called Chickadee Bread.

If there’s a through line to these diverse businesses, it’s Mack’s obsession with highly specialized kitchen machinery. His interest in cured meats arose partly from his first big purchase: a meat slicer manufactured in 1910. A Texas native, he got serious about making breakfast tacos only after he bought a top-of-the-line industrial tortilla press. In the spring of 2020, he woke up after an evening of drinking and said to Damrosch, “I think I bought a flour mill last night.” Indeed, he had: custom granite, made to order in Vermont, now in use at Chickadee.

& Sons Hospitality Group’s culinary director, Nico Bouter, who was the chef de cuisine at Ignacio Mattos’s Flora Bar, can more than handle it all. At the Buttery, he devised a menu of simple but inspired sandwiches. (A standout features soft-boiled heirloom egg, anchovies, and pesto on sourdough.) Born in the Netherlands, he took to tacos with ease, overseeing the daily pressing of Mockingbird’s superlative flour tortillas, which get filled with house-made chorizo and scrambled heirloom eggs, or Rancho Gordo black beans and Grafton Cheddar.

Kingfisher could be loosely categorized as a seafood restaurant, but “our concept was ‘Let’s just cook,’ ” Mack told me recently. It was time to let Bouter flex his chops: “I mean, this guy—I’m asking him to make sandwiches!” In a kitchen that’s only slightly better equipped than the hot-plate setups at & Sons and Mockingbird, Bouter displays a nimble efficiency. The eggs that he uses at the Buttery and at Mockingbird—from Ameraucana chickens, a breed that produces beautiful blue shells and vibrant orange yolks—are here, too: in hollandaise, he tosses coins of fingerling potato, crunchy croutons made from stale Chickadee loaves, glossy trout roe, and tobiko, then crowns the intoxicating combination with two medium-boiled halves, egg on egg on egg on egg. Another dish exalts the potato: crushed kettle chips are folded into an earthy fingerling purée and topped with poached Purple Majesties, on a plate that also incorporates an emerald-hued herb purée, a dill-prominent herb salad, and tender medallions of monkfish loin.

The shrimp cocktail was as good as I remembered. Slabs of raw hiramasa, a type of yellowtail, brilliantly layered with XO sauce, Asian pear, and shiso leaves, gave me a similar thrill, and I was emboldened to break my ban on fluke crudo, a dish that’s inexplicably omnipresent, and often phoned in, at upmarket restaurants of late. Satiny morsels of the mellow white fish were dressed with yuzu kosho, toasted pepitas, and raw cubes of pickled butternut squash, gone al dente in their brine—a sensationally bright, zippy, and textured composition that somehow also read as gentle and creamy, the familiar turned fresh. (Dishes $6-$36.)
