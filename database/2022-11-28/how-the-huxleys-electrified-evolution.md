Thomas Henry Huxley almost skipped the showdown of his life. It was the fourth day of the 1860 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was tired. He had spent the earlier part of the conference mingling, attending talks, and defending his friend Charles Darwin’s new book, “On the Origin of Species.” He was keen to escape the Oxford bustle and relax with his wife at her sister’s home, near Reading.

He knew that the fourth day would be charged. Everyone did. The Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, was scheduled to appear. The son of the abolitionist William Wilberforce, the Bishop was considered one of the greatest orators of his time—part viper, part soapbox parliamentarian. He had been armed with anti-evolution arguments by one of Darwin’s rivals, the anatomist Richard Owen, and arrived in Oxford ready to deploy.

“I trust you will not allow yourself to be in any way disgusted or annoyed by the considerable abuse and misrepresentation which, unless I am greatly mistaken, is in store for you,” Huxley had written Darwin just before the publication of “The Origin.” “I am sharpening up my claws and beak in readiness.” And indeed, in the seven months since the book’s publication, Huxley had showed up slashing and pecking. He wrote reviews and rebuttals for the London Times, Macmillan’s Magazine, and The Westminster Review. In a public lecture for the Royal Institution, he not only defended “The Origin” but also explored its most sacrilegious implication: our kinship with apes.

Still, he expected a confrontation with the Bishop to be trickier. Huxley later recalled that Wilberforce “had the reputation of being a first-class controversialist.” He could hardly “see the good of giving up some peace and quietness to be episcopally pounded.” But peer pressure got to him. He explained that a fellow-evolutionist had accused him of deserting the Darwinians: “So, I said, ‘Oh! if you are going to take it that way, I’ll come and have my share of what is going on.’ ”

The resulting face-off is now legendary. It was included in Hal Hellman’s book “Great Feuds in Science: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever” (1998). It was reënacted in the PBS documentary series “Evolution” (2001) and the BBC television show “The Voyage of Charles Darwin” (1978). It inspired Crispin Whittell’s play “Darwin in Malibu” (2003), which imagined Darwin, Huxley, and Wilberforce meeting in a beach house in the afterlife more than a century after their deaths. And, like one of those enormous mama spiders carrying an ungodly number of spiderlings, it continues to spawn a relentless stream of scholarly papers, including an article published last year titled “Enough of Galileo and the Huxley-Wilberforce Debate.”

Today, the showdown is remembered less for its scholarly arguments and more for one of the zestier Victorian comebacks on record. After railing against “The Origin,” the Bishop addressed Huxley and, according to the London weekly The Press, “asked the Professor whether he would prefer a monkey for his grandfather or his grandmother.” There are different versions of Huxley’s response, although the one he reported a few months later is (no surprise) the most eloquent: “If then, said I, the question is put to me would I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed of great means and influence and yet who employs these faculties and that influence for the mere purpose of introducing ridicule into a grave scientific discussion—I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape.”

By this point, Huxley had eclipsed his upbringing. Born in 1825 and brought up in a lower-middle-class family, he received just two years of formal education before apprenticing to his rambunctious, opium-chewing brother-in-law, the doctor John Cooke. After pursuing more medical training, he was assigned to the Royal Navy’s H.M.S. Rattlesnake as an assistant surgeon. The ship’s voyage to Australia and New Guinea, which lasted four years, revealed Huxley’s talents in natural history. He spent his spare time dissecting marine invertebrates and mailing manuscripts to England. While he stewed in self-doubt in the South Seas, his scientific work was attracting attention at home, appearing in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and in Proceedings of the Zoological Society. When he arrived back in England, in 1850, Huxley learned that he had become a noted scientist. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1851, won its medal for physiology in 1852, and by 1854 had secured a lectureship in natural history at the Government School of Mines (now part of Imperial College London).

Even with his rising profile, the showdown with Wilberforce was a turning point for Huxley. He was, he later recalled, “the most popular man in Oxford for full four & twenty hours.” More important, he gained a new perspective on public speaking, becoming convinced that he “should carefully cultivate it, and try to leave off hating it.” While Darwin, forever sickly, stayed at home in the following years, Huxley fought as evolution’s champion. He used his growing influence to expand scientific education, and he grappled with ethics and religion. (He coined the term “agnostic” in 1869.) From relatively modest beginnings, Thomas Henry Huxley became one of the most prominent public intellectuals in the English-speaking world.

It was fitting for a man known as “Darwin’s bulldog” that his descendants inherited many of his traits—not just his talents but also his affinity for certain sweeping questions: Who are we? What is our place in nature? How can we design morality and religion in a world informed by science? In “The Huxleys: An Intimate History of Evolution” (Chicago), the historian Alison Bashford moves across the Huxley generations, tracing how Thomas Henry and his gifted brood struggled to answer these questions, in the process shaping outlooks we hold today.

Bashford focusses her chronicle on the two most evolutionarily minded Huxleys: Thomas Henry and his grandson Julian. The eldest child of Huxley’s son Leonard—himself a notable writer and magazine editor—Julian enjoyed not one but two illustrious bloodlines. His mother, Julia, came from the Arnold family, a clan famed for its writers and scholars. (Matthew Arnold was her uncle.) After Julia’s untimely death, in 1908, her sister, the best-selling novelist Mrs. Humphry Ward, both mentored Julian in his literary ventures and became a second mother to him and his siblings, Aldous, Trevenen, and Margaret.

Julian’s bond with his paternal grandfather was special. “I like that chap!” Huxley said when Julian was four. “I like the way he looks you straight in the face and disobeys you.”

Like his grandfather, Julian was a nerd for nature. As that four-year-old, he asked, “Why do all live things have natures?” Some three years later, when Huxley remarked that parental care was absent in fish, Julian interjected, “What about the stickleback, Grand-pater?” Their connection is apparent in a letter Huxley wrote Julian close to his fifth birthday: “There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things. When you grow up I dare say you will be one of the great-deal seers and see things more wonderful than water babies where other folks can see nothing.”

Thomas Henry died in 1895, days after Julian turned eight. But, as an adult, too, Julian took after his grandfather. Both men were moral, extroverted, sometimes tortured, and sometimes arrogant. They were also ambitious synthesizers, wildly successful storytellers, and agnostic materialists dazzled by the expansiveness of nature. They were so alike that Bashford says they can even be thought of as “one very long-lived man, 1825–1975.”

“The Huxleys” is an intimate history of evolution in several senses. First, it chronicles the understanding of evolution by two of the theory’s most zealous apostles. In the decades after “The Origin” was published, a Darwinian brand of evolutionary theory spread, fuelled in large part by Thomas Henry’s advocacy. By 1900, however, “the eclipse of Darwinism” (to use Julian’s phrase) was setting in. Evolution was widely accepted, yet natural selection seemed a tad too fantastical. Was the Earth truly old enough for a process as slow as selection to have fashioned the diversity of life? Could the eyes of mammals and squids—so complex, so similar—really have evolved through blind tinkering? Reinforcing such objections was the fact that Darwin got some important things wrong, most notably inheritance. He believed that the traits of progeny were blended averages of their parents’ traits, yet Gregor Mendel seemed to show that traits were passed down as discrete units. Biologists struggled to square new discoveries about inheritance with Darwin’s ideas. When Julian studied zoology at Oxford, from 1906 to 1909, the discipline was in the process of abandoning natural selection.

Julian wasn’t going to give up on Grandfather’s credo. But neither—as he bounced from Oxford to Rice University to Oxford again, eventually landing at King’s College London—was he eager to settle into a specialty. “For goodness sake do decide which branch of biology you are expert in,” the marine biologist George Parker Bidder implored him in 1925. “A man now cannot be a universal expert. . . . You must not be led away by the notion of imitating your grandfather.” Julian, defiant as always, ignored the advice. In 1927, he abandoned academia to write a sweeping summary of biology, “The Science of Life,” with H. G. Wells and his son G. P. Wells. Widely popular—both David Attenborough and Walt Disney later gushed about it—the book buoyed Julian’s passion for storytelling and synthesis.

His own crucial vindication of Darwinian theory appeared in the book “Evolution: The Modern Synthesis” (1942), which reanimated the program. “The death of Darwinism has been proclaimed not only from the pulpit, but from the biological laboratory,” Julian wrote, but he meant to show that Darwinism was “very much alive.” The book—notable for its breadth, its clarity, and its literary flair—articulated a new vision of evolutionary theory, reconciling natural selection with insights from a slew of subdisciplines, including genetics, paleontology, and cell biology. It was also a quintessentially Huxley project. In a review for American Scientist, the geologist Kirtley Mather called Julian’s defense of Darwinism “amusingly reminiscent of bygone days when another Huxley championed the cause of evolution in a wholly different battle.”

In the half century before his death, Julian wrote some forty other books. He also won an Academy Award, ran the London Zoo, helped found the World Wildlife Fund, served as unesco’s first director-general, popularized the term “transhumanism,” and coined the words “clade” and “cline.” Along the way, he and his wife, Juliette, raised two sons—a botanist, Anthony, and an anthropologist, Francis. Truly his grandfather’s grandson, Julian rose from being a disciple of Darwin to serving as a mouthpiece for science itself.

“The Huxleys” is more than an account of how two celebrity scholars fashioned and sold evolution. It is also about the implications that the men discerned in activities ranging from religion to conservation. The most important among these implications concerned ethics.

Two stories can be told about the Huxleys in this regard. According to one, they were progressive anti-racists who used science for good. The elder Huxley, a comparative anatomist, marshalled evidence to refute racist pseudoscience. His research countered common beliefs about Africans being more “ape-like” than Europeans. He railed against the polygenists, who argued that Europeans and Africans were akin to different species and whose writings served as justifications for slavery in the American South. His observations, demonstrating our common humanity, became buckshot in the war against slavery. The Ladies’ London Emancipation Society gathered quotations from his lectures into an abolitionist pamphlet, “Professor Huxley on the Negro Question” (1864), declaring that his scientific work equated to “an earnest plea for Negro emancipation.”

Julian carried on his grandfather’s crusade against race science. With the anthropologist Alfred Cort Haddon, he published “We Europeans: A Survey of ‘Racial Problems’ ” (1935), a book that debunked what its authors called a “vast pseudo-science of ‘racial biology’ ” endorsed by fascist nationalists. The book’s conclusions have since become common sense: The idea of a “pure” race is flawed. What we call “the Germans” or “the French” are in fact mixtures of many ancestral populations. The project of distilling a racially unpolluted people through reproductive policy is scientifically obtuse. Julian fought against Nazism and race science for years thereafter, most famously in the documentary “Man— One Family” (1946) and in his manifesto “unesco: Its Purpose and Its Philosophy” (1946).

And yet another story can easily be told: Thomas Henry was a racist and an imperialist. According to Bashford, he believed that human variation was organized hierarchically, with the white man presumably on top. Although he was an abolitionist, his rooting interest was with white people. “I have not the smallest sentimental sympathy with the negro,” he wrote his sister Lizzie in 1864, within months of the publication of “Professor Huxley on the Negro Question.” He advocated for emancipation, yes, but “for the sake of the white man”—for his politics, his morality, and his economy.

Julian doesn’t come out looking much better. He was racially prejudiced and, despite all his talk about “the family of man,” doubted non-Europeans’ sophistication. More damningly, he was a eugenicist—not just vaguely sympathetic but a big-time proselytizer, waving the banner even after the Nazi atrocities, and eventually ascending to the presidency of the British Eugenics Society.

Both stories have their truth, of course, leaving modern interpreters unmoored. Should the Huxleys be celebrated or vilified? In 1969, Western Washington University named its new environmental college after the elder Huxley. Half a century later, in 2021, a task force recommended removing his name because his “white supremacist values” served to “dehumanize and harm many members of the Western community.” The task force’s report was riddled with inaccuracies, many of which were documented in a response from ten Western Washington University faculty members. Still, a more responsible group commissioned by Imperial College London arrived at a similar recommendation: rename Imperial’s Huxley Building and exile Huxley’s bust to the archives. (W.W.U. has removed his name; Imperial will consider adjoining the name of a scientist from a minority group.)

Although Bashford is avowedly sympathetic to Julian, she tends to avoid moral pronouncements, viewing the Huxleys’ positions instead as artifacts of historical study: examples of the weight of cultural inheritance, snapshots of the ever-changing relationship between evolution and ethics, and paradoxes that illuminate a different way of thinking. She is especially fascinated by eugenics. For many readers, Julian’s advocacy might seem incomprehensible. He was an opponent of biological racism and yet a spokesman for population-level genetic planning; a decrier of Nazi atrocities, yet a crusader for sterilization.

But Julian’s position was far from unusual. In the nineteen-twenties and thirties, he joined a squad of biologists, including Hermann Muller and J. B. S. Haldane, who combined progressive and sometimes socialist agendas with eugenic fervor. For them, genetic planning was a facet of a modern utopian state: a tool for good that needed to be severed from the corrosive evils of ethnonationalism and racial prejudice.

They laid out their vision in a 1939 manifesto titled “Social Biology and Population Improvement.” Published in Nature two weeks after Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland, the manifesto called for radical reforms: Establish equality of opportunity. End racial and national discord. Legalize and develop birth control. Provide social welfare, and alleviate burdens on women. Teach people that heredity and the environment interact to affect well-being. Institute a social system that prioritizes “the good of mankind at large.” The manifesto was more leftist than was typical for Julian, but its anti-racism, internationalism, and birth-control advocacy were familiar Huxley stances.

A key point of the Geneticists’ Manifesto (as it is sometimes known) is that eugenic planning requires these reforms. Our understanding of genetics remains impoverished, it asserted; there is “no valid basis” for assessing the genetic component of individuals’ intelligence or temperament as long as they come from unequal social backgrounds. Even so, Julian campaigned for eugenic policies, particularly those connected to health. He was convinced, he said, by data showing that “mental and physical defect runs in families” and that small measures, mostly voluntary sterilization, “could enormously reduce the burden of defective humanity.” This advocacy was striking because Julian and his family were members of the targeted group. Not only did they suffer from mental illness—Julian considered it their genetic burden.

The Huxleys had many names for the dark spells that afflicted them. Thomas Henry called them “paroxysms of internal pain.” Julian used the phrase “the malady of thought.” His brother Aldous preferred “accidie,” Chaucer’s term for a “hevy, thoghtful, and wrawe” state. Whatever it was called, Julian deemed it a hereditary scourge.

Bashford locates haunting passages in Julian’s private writings. After the birth of his firstborn, he grieved the torture that his son would inherit: “Your mind . . . will maybe collapse & leave you shelterless, will be ugly, will be so bewitched as to turn (when least expected) from a palace of an Arcadian bower into a pigsty or a prison.” Bashford notes that the words read almost like a curse.

The malady could be crippling. Julian suffered a nervous breakdown before he was supposed to start at Rice, delaying his departure for America by some four months. During another episode, he became near-catatonic—a sad, still, silent facsimile of his usually ebullient self. All the same, he fared better than some other Huxleys did. Thomas Henry’s daughter Marian was despondent after giving birth, and later died in psychiatric care. Julian and Aldous’s brother Trev hanged himself at the age of twenty-four.

Julian, in his autobiography “Memories,” speculated that the malady was genetically inherited, and Bashford offers no alternative explanation. But other observers stress a different inheritance: the heavy expectations levied on the Huxley children and grandchildren. Julian thought that his brother’s suicide was triggered by a failed love affair, but Trev’s “desperate fits of melancholia,” as one biographer put it, began months earlier, after a disappointing performance on the Civil Service exam. “There is something really devastating about having a grandfather (Grand-pater as they called him) who was a god in the family,” Juliette, Julian’s wife, said in a 1985 interview. “These children grew up with that atmosphere: ‘Worthy of Grand-Pater —right! You must be worthy of Grand-pater.’ ”

The sense of unfulfilled potential comes across in Julian’s writings. After his first son’s birth, he wrote, “It is the eternal wish of fathers to instruct their sons in the art of living. They make so many mistakes themselves, they regret so much of life wasted, such energies dissipated, so many hopes on the rocks. Such exquisite possibilities crumbled into nothing.”

If Julian and his grandfather are the stars of Bashford’s book, Aldous Huxley is the celebrity who makes the occasional cameo. Best known for his books “Brave New World” (1932) and “The Doors of Perception” (1954), Aldous might seem like a Huxley outlier. Where Julian and Thomas Henry easily fuse into a single long-lived spokesman for evolution, Aldous appears to be something else entirely: a mystical, half-blind novelist; an aloof stork—he was famously tall and gawky—who escaped to the American desert. The English biographer Ronald W. Clark promoted this image in a 1968 book, also titled “The Huxleys.” Comparing the brothers in the early nineteen-tens, he wrote that Julian, then a twentysomething zoologist, “showed to formidable degree the traits of TH.” The teen-age Aldous, by contrast, was already “so different from the rest, so curiously adult, so like an Arnold.”

Yet Aldous was just as much Thomas Henry’s grandson. He planned to become a physician until an infection compromised his eyesight, and he maintained a lifelong interest in biology. In 1948, the writer Osbert Sitwell recalled Aldous’s knack for talking about arcane biological subjects, including “the incestuous mating of melons, the elaborate love-making of lepidoptera, or the curious amorous habits of cuttlefish.” In the final years of his life, Aldous still considered himself “a cheerleader for evolution.” And his intellectual companionship with Julian—which unfolded through a decades-long correspondence—was so consequential that the work of each can partly be understood as a dialogue with the other.

Bashford offers glimpses of how Julian and Aldous shaped each other’s views, although the better book on the topic is Richard Deese’s “We Are Amphibians: Julian and Aldous Huxley on the Future of Our Species” (2015). The brothers, Deese showed, were gripped by similar trends: the centralization of state power, the growth of industrialized society, the transformation of human nature through scientific discovery. Yet they often disagreed about what these trends meant. For Julian, they were engines of progress. For Aldous, they foreshadowed tyranny.

These differences were apparent in projects they worked on in 1931. Julian, a fan of rationally planned societies, invited his younger brother on a tour of the U.S.S.R. Aldous declined. He had to finish a novel, he said, and, besides, he saw evil designs in the U.S.S.R.’s utopian schemes. The next year, Julian published his observations from the trip in “A Scientist Among the Soviets,” a honey-tongued account of the country’s economic and scientific achievements. Aldous, meanwhile, published “Brave New World,” his vision of a rational utopia gone wrong. The books drew on similar images of state power—athletic bodies, state-sponsored nurseries, community singing—even as they came to opposite conclusions about the significance of such power.

Julian influenced “Brave New World” beyond supplying an ideological sparring partner. The novel explored futurist speculations that Julian had put forward in “What Dare I Think?” (1931), including a designer drug that would one day be taken by millions. The novel further drew on Julian’s work in having Mustapha Mond, the face of the dystopian government, come across a paper arguing that evolution favored expanded consciousness, a view that Julian had expounded in several recent books. H. G. Wells considered “Brave New World” an attack on his own utopian daydreams, but the book can also be read as an extended letter from one future-obsessed brother to another.

Thomas Henry Huxley and Bishop Wilberforce debated evolution that day in 1860 because Darwinism was dangerous. By explaining the origin of species without divine intervention, it threatened to destabilize Christianity. God was elbowed out of the picture, replaced by an impersonal process of survival and reproduction. When we extrapolate this conflict to the modern day, it is easy to see evolution and religion as fundamentally incompatible, especially since some of evolution’s most vocal apostles, like Richard Dawkins, rank among religion’s most fiery opponents.

The irony is that Huxley was a fan of religion. When running for the London School Board in 1870, he proposed that two hours be allocated weekly to religious instruction. He supported Bible readings in school, which he thought useful for cultivating morality. He also studied Biblical history with rabbinic care. Although he is remembered for his research on crayfish, gorillas, and marine invertebrates, his notes on the Old Testament far exceeded what he compiled on any of those critters. He devoured Jewish history and trawled Biblical scholarship, producing his own “Genealogy of the Horites and Genealogy of the Edomites.” An agnostic through and through, he believed that the generations and chronologies of Genesis made no sense but thought that other statements in the Old Testament might be true.

For Huxley, evolution meant not the end of religion but, rather, religion’s reconstruction—“a new ethical formula, a new set of beliefs, a new pattern of rules by which humanity might live,” in Ronald Clark’s words. His heirs Julian and Aldous took up this pursuit, seeking traditions that were both compatible with science and resonant with humanity’s religious impulses. Predictably, though, the brothers ended up with different creeds.

Julian developed what he called “evolutionary humanism,” a mashup of his favorite progressivist themes. It featured in many of his lectures and books, although he discussed it in greatest detail in “Religion Without Revelation” (1927). Central to the ideology was humanity’s purpose: we are the children of a cosmic process that produces ever-greater intelligence and complexity. There could be no more important common aim than to take control of that process—to overcome our individual and tribal identities and achieve the more advanced mode of collective existence he called transhumanism. Evolutionary humanism, given its focus on the betterment of the species, became welded to eugenics. This might explain why, as eugenics lost legitimacy, evolutionary humanism became all but forgotten.

Where Julian focussed on unity and transhumanism, Aldous turned to experience. As an undergraduate at Oxford, he wrote to Julian about his conviction that the higher states of consciousness described by mystics were achievable. The fascination persisted, and, by the nineteen-thirties, Aldous believed that society’s aim should be to nurture the pursuit of enlightened consciousness. By the time he published “The Doors of Perception” (1954), which connected his experience on the drug mescaline to the universal urge for self-transcendence, he had been writing and lecturing on mystical experiences for decades. Through this commitment, Aldous helped pioneer a form of secular mysticism that suffuses modern attitudes, showing up in things like New Age yoga and psychedelic-assisted therapy. An inheritor of evolution, the half-blind stork wrested sublime experience from the caverns of institutionalized religion.

The history of the Huxleys reveals a paradox in how we think about evolution. On the one hand, it exemplifies our impulse to find answers in cosmology. As organized religion declined, people sought guidance and justification in the scientific narratives taking its place. From race science to eugenics, progress to spirituality, the Huxleys combed our deep past for modern implications, feeding an ever-present yearning.

On the other hand, the Huxleys expose how diverse and historically contingent those implications can be. Evolution is a messy, nuanced, protean picture of our origins. It offers many stories, yet those which we choose to tell have their own momentum. It can serve as a banner of our common humanity or as a narrative of our staggering differences. It can be wielded to fight racism or weaponized to support oppression. It can inspire new forms of piety or be called on to destroy dogma. The social meanings of evolution, like so much else, are part of a grander inheritance.
