First, it chronicles the understanding of evolution by two of the theory\u2019s most zealous apostles. In the decades after \u201cThe Origin\u201d was published, a Darwinian brand of evolutionary theory spread, fuelled in large part by Thomas Henry\u2019s advocacy. By 1900, however, \u201cthe eclipse of Darwinism\u201d (to use Julian\u2019s phrase) was setting in. Evolution was widely accepted, yet natural selection seemed a tad too fantastical. Was the Earth truly old enough for a process as slow as selection to have fashioned the diversity of life? Could the eyes of mammals and squids\u2014so complex, so similar\u2014really have evolved through blind tinkering? Reinforcing such objections was the fact that Darwin got some important things wrong, most notably inheritance. He believed that the traits of progeny were blended averages of their parents\u2019 traits, yet Gregor Mendel seemed to show that traits were passed down as discrete units. Biologists struggled to square new discoveries about inheritance with Darwin\u2019s ideas. When Julian studied zoology at Oxford, from 1906 to 1909, the discipline was in the process of abandoning natural selection."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Julian wasn\u2019t going to give up on Grandfather\u2019s credo.

You must not be led away by the notion of imitating your grandfather.\u201d Julian, defiant as always, ignored the advice. In 1927, he abandoned academia to write a sweeping summary of biology, \u201cThe Science of Life,\u201d with H. G. Wells and his son G. P. Wells.

It was also a quintessentially Huxley project.

He railed against the polygenists, who argued that Europeans and Africans were akin to different species and whose writings served as justifications for slavery in the American South.

He was convinced, he said, by data showing that \u201cmental and physical defect runs in families\u201d and that small measures, mostly voluntary sterilization, \u201ccould enormously reduce the burden of defective humanity.\u201d This advocacy was striking because Julian and his family were members of the targeted group.
