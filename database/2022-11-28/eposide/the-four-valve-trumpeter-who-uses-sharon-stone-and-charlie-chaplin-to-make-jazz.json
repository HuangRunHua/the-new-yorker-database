Maalouf, who is forty-two, lives in Paris and was in town for a concert. He had been curious about the museum\u2019s horn collection, which includes not just the six-valve trombone\u2014most have none\u2014but also a vaguely bassoon-like thing (an ophicleide!) with a bell decorated to look like a dragon\u2019s mouth, and a tuba with two bells that resemble conjoined twins. In Maalouf\u2019s view, much of what was on display\u2014arcane, intestinal-looking contrivances of coiled brass\u2014was more a tribute to the metalworker\u2019s craft than anything a working musician might want to play."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Not that Maalouf is a fussy traditionalist. His own preferred instrument is a unique trumpet with four valves (one more than the usual three), which allows him to play the quarter tones of classical Arabic music. He studied European classical music at the Conservatoire de Paris, but made his name playing jazz. He has since embraced electronic music, R. & B., hip-hop, Arabic pop, and other styles, collaborating with such musicians as Wynton Marsalis, Sting, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Juliette Gr\u00e9co, Josh Groban, and the Kronos Quartet. He\u2019s a superstar in Europe, where he regularly sells out arenas; in American instrumentalist terms, he might be placed on a continuum between Kenny G and Jon Batiste, closer to the former in fame and to the latter in style and critical respect. At the Met, dressed in black, with a groomed beard, he could have passed for Rainer Werner Fassbinder\u2019s better-adjusted kid brother."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maalouf\u2019s father, Nassim Maalouf, a renowned soloist in both European and Arabic classical music, invented the four-valve trumpet that both men play. Ibrahim grew up listening to his father practice. One day, he asked if he could try. \u201cMy father said, \u2018If you want me to teach you, you will be a trumpet player.\u2019 I was seven. I didn\u2019t know what that commitment meant.\u201d He quickly showed promise, but there were bumps along the way. For one thing, if you live with your trumpet teacher, you can\u2019t cheat on practicing."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cHe gave me lessons every day, until I was fourteen or fifteen,\u201d Maalouf recalled. Home life was otherwise hard. He was born in Beirut in 1980, but the family soon fled Lebanon\u2019s violence for France; the loss and the upheaval, he said, affected his parents deeply. Nassim was a very strict father. \u201cThe only moments he was really soft were when I was taking trumpet lessons,\u201d Maalouf said. He laughed. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I kept playing.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a sad turn of family melodrama at least as old as \u201cThe Jazz Singer,\u201d Maalouf\u2019s embrace of more modern and popular music contributed to an estrangement between father and son. For Nassim, who had no formal education outside of music, the trumpet had been a way out of rural poverty. \u201cIt was his tool to escape his destiny,\u201d Maalouf said. \u201cAnd he expected I would exactly continue his way of playing.\u201d Today, they exchange only the occasional text. \u201cWe disagree on pretty much everything.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maalouf\u2019s latest album, \u201cCapacity to Love,\u201d his seventeenth\u2014not including the many French film scores he has composed, plus a couple of symphonies\u2014may push his father even farther away. Overtly polemical, it is meant as a musical riposte to the right-wing nationalism gripping Europe and other places around the world. Maalouf enlisted a diverse array of collaborators, including the rappers Pos (of De La Soul) and Erick the Architect; the jazz singer Gregory Porter; musicians from South America and Africa; and, perhaps most daringly, Sharon Stone, a movie star not previously known for her musical gifts. On one track, over a mournful orchestral backdrop and Maalouf\u2019s trumpet, Stone recites an original poem, an angry address to an unnamed American politician (we all know who)."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maalouf approached Stone, he said, because he admires her \u201cstrong voice\u201d and her willingness to speak her mind even at the risk of sounding \u201cstupid.\u201d He had wanted a Hollywood figure to help close the album, which begins with an audio clip of Charlie Chaplin\u2019s final speech from \u201cThe Great Dictator.\u201d The film, with its plea for tolerance and \u201cuniversal brotherhood,\u201d had made an impression on Maalouf when he first saw it, in grammar school, as the only Arab in his class."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cWhen I do a concert, I like that there are all kinds of people listening to me, even people who don\u2019t believe in the same things as me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re moved, then we\u2019ve shared something.\u201d Would he welcome even Marine Le Pen or Donald Trump as a fan? \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes little things can change opinions on big things. Maybe they would have some part of their mind that thinks, Maybe, you know, maybe\u2014maybe\u2014I\u2019m wrong.\u201d"}]}
