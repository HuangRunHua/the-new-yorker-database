He opened a file of a film made by a friend named Ash Sanders. \u201cThis is what she called \u2018The Putty Movie,\u2019 \u201d he said. She made it when she was sixteen."}, {"role": "body", "text": "He clicked and the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme played. Two girls dressed in camouflage sneak around a house, arms aloft in victory. The soundtrack changes to nineties house music, and one of the girls sprints down a driveway and jumps on the hood of a moving car. \u201cThis whole section has such a good ambient quality,\u201d Whitear said. Finally, dialogue: \u201cWe have something that belongs to you,\u201d a voice says. \u201cRecognize this?\u201d Cut to a flesh-colored mound of Silly Putty with googly eyes, and a complicated discussion of why half the putty is being held captive at another location. The voice grants the putty a last wish, \u201ca song to express her undying love for you.\u201d \u201cHold Me Now,\u201d by the Thompson Twins, is heard over a montage of pictures of a blond teen boy."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Whitear, who wears round, owlish glasses and has messy blond hair, was culling submissions for a special screening event\u2014his birthday party, which he is calling the Childhood Delusions Film Festival. He had e-mailed a few dozen friends with a request to send him movies that they\u2019d made when they were kids. \u201cThese cringey masterworks deserve to finally be seen on the big screen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo I am renting a movie theater and making that happen! It\u2019s like a gift from a 35 year-old me to a 12 year-old you, except not creepy at all.\u201d There were a few rules: submissions couldn\u2019t be longer than five minutes or be made after someone turned twenty-one."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Despite the time rule, not all of the people who sent in digital files (and DVDs and CDs) had edited down their juvenile masterworks. Some submissions were raw tape, hours of filmmaking attempts piled one on top of the other. In some cases, what the filmmaker thought would be the most interesting part wasn\u2019t. A podcast producer named Abigail Keel sent in one such VHS tape. \u201cShe was specifically asking me to look for this video of her and her Mexican exchange student,\u201d Whitear said. \u201cThey made some kind of kung-fu thing together.\u201d What he found more compelling is a scene that she and her girlfriends made about a diva-ish pop star. He clicked: Grainy footage of a tween girl holding a hairbrush as a mike, talking to another tween, who is the \u201cmother.\u201d The \u201cpop star\u201d tells the mother that she\u2019s not even invited to her show and should think about \u201clife\u2014you need a new one!\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Next up, a black-and-white short of a pool game from the perspective of a shy cue ball, which whispers, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to break up your little pack.\u201d Then an eleven-minute epic, a spoof on \u201cTo Catch a Predator,\u201d made for English class. It depicts a dystopian plantation led by a high-school kid in a preppy pink shirt. Then an impressive stop-motion piece populated by Lego figures, showing a bank heist. Whitear planned to edit his final picks for time, but not for content. \u201cYou have to let them have the childhood logic,\u201d he said. He hoped to show something from everyone who submitted, except for a video composed of hand-drawn storyboards about the relationship between a child and his dolls. It was too long, but its creator had declared that it could not be touched."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Finally, Whitear took a look at his own submission, a seventeen-minute film called \u201cThe Black Sun,\u201d which he made when he was twelve. The original cut was ninety minutes; watching it, he said, was \u201cabsolutely unbearable, like, five-minute sections of no dialogue, really bad.\u201d Shooting it with a handheld camera had made him so nauseated that his grandfather bought him a tripod. One of the film\u2019s stars, Whitear\u2019s cat, Mr. B, died during the six weeks of filming. Over the years, Whitear has re\u00ebdited it multiple times."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cI\u2019m going to call this \u2018The Final Super Director\u2019s Cut,\u2019 \u201d he said. Like the other young auteurs, he\u2019d designed his own title card\u2014in his case, a fake Twentieth Century Fox logo, with fanfare. The action begins with a boy rolling down a suburban hill; he is a federal agent exploring a private island that is inhabited by stop-motion dinosaurs. Whitear smiled at his younger self on the screen. \u201cEvery time I make a new version of this, I show it to a lot of people, and no one is, like, \u2018Yeah, Curtis, I see why you love this movie,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m still working on this. I can\u2019t quit it.\u201d"}]}
