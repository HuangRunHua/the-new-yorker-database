But it all traces back to \u201cSome Like It Hot,\u201d Billy Wilder\u2019s classic film from 1959. A new musical version, in previews at the Shubert, with direction by Casey Nicholaw and songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (\u201cHairspray\u201d), aims to splice the old-school fun with contemporary gender politics. Adrianna Hicks, J. Harrison Ghee, and Christian Borle (above, left to right) lead the cast."}]}
