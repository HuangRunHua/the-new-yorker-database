Hedge funds are scooping up TV stations. Billionaires are buying newspapers and tech platforms. A few hours before Elon Musk finalized a deal to purchase Twitter, last month, a super pac turned artists\u2019 collective launched a news network in the lobby of the Brooklyn Museum. (Mission statement: \u201cNews for creative emancipation. This is journalism made by the people making culture.\u201d) \u201cI love things like \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 and Ali G, but we\u2019re trying to actually make news, and be the news,\u201d Eric Gottesman, an artist who is co-directing the project, said. He co-founded the collective, which is called For Freedoms. Its news program is more pastiche than parody: \u201cWe\u2019re appropriating the form and aesthetic of broadcast news as a way to build greater civic engagement through art.\u201d He added, \u201cAnd we have a news desk!\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "At 8 a.m., a group of gaffers, grips, lighting technicians, and caterers arrived to set up. Massive batteries were rolled into place; cameras, microphones, and stage lights were arranged."}, {"role": "body", "text": "An artist named Christina Caputo, one of the producers, arrived at ten. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily call myself an artist,\u201d she said. Caputo led the crew in a \u201cgrounding session.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s take a moment and appreciate each other,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are gonna be moments when there are challenges, and there are gonna be moments when we love each other.\u201d Inhale, exhale; the crew was restless. \u201cExcuse me, where should we place the monitor?\u201d a technician whispered to Gottesman. Soon the news desk, designed by the artist Harry Chadha and accented with purple starfish, was assembled; someone had accidentally printed part of the collective\u2019s logo upside down."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Gottesman didn\u2019t mind, he said, looking up at a huge canvas by Cecily Brown that was hanging above the newsroom. \u201cWe had to make sure that none of the lights would melt the painting,\u201d he added. He was eating a roasted-vegetable sandwich, and his mouth was smeared with mustard. \u201cThis is both an installation and a site of capture,\u201d he said."}, {"role": "body", "text": "A few crew members sat behind the news desk, joking around. \u201cWe need some diversity onscreen,\u201d a Black key grip named Che Roacher said. As a camera test, he decided to give an impromptu monologue: \u201cThey own everything. It\u2019s fucking impossible. This country is owned by the powerful and rich. It\u2019s been that way forever.\u201d Some of the artists had gathered near the monitors, holding ginger-lemon probiotic sodas, to watch."}, {"role": "body", "text": "For Freedoms was started in 2016 as an antipartisan super pac; since then, the group has worked with more than a thousand artists, including Carrie Mae Weems, Ai Weiwei, Marilyn Minter, and David Byrne, on civic-minded art projects. In one, a flag designed by the artist Dread Scott, reading \u201cA Man Was Lynched by Police Yesterday,\u201d was hung outside a gallery. Another placed more than five hundred artist-designed political billboards across all fifty states. The news program would feature dozens of artists doing broadcasts streamed online: Duke Riley giving a woman named Sandy a Hurricane Sandy-inspired tattoo, to mark the storm\u2019s tenth anniversary; a monologue on intimate-partner violence and houseplants, delivered by Tanya Selvaratnam, one of three women who, in 2016, accused Eric Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general at the time, of abusing them. \u201cI like plants more than people,\u201d she said."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/63770d68e3958a4a2ac1ae26/master/w_1600,c_limit/221128_a27165.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1137, "imageDescription": "\u201cI\u2019m his muse, which he says is even better than co-author.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "A few grips and gaffers appraised the catered lunch (a salad of greens grown in a vacant city lot) and headed out to get some Chinese. \u201cThat rabbit food is not cutting it,\u201d one said.
