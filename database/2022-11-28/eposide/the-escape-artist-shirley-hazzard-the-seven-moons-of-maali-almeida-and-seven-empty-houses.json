In 1944, the Auschwitz escapee Rudolf Vrba, intent on piercing the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d surrounding the Nazis\u2019 crimes, related his and others\u2019 experiences of the camp in the Vrba-Wetzler Report. Disseminated in the midst of the war, the report catalyzed an international response that would ultimately spare two hundred thousand Hungarian Jews. With the propulsion of a historical thriller, Freedland, a journalist, tracks Vrba\u2019s work collecting the \u201cdata of the dead\u201d even while imprisoned, driven by his conviction that facts could perhaps derail the Nazi extermination plan. As Freedland depicts world leaders\u2019 failure to act expeditiously, he observes, \u201cA horror is especially hard to comprehend if no one has ever witnessed anything like it before.\u201d"}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6374106e917568ad20538bea/master/w_1600,c_limit/221128_r41424_rdweb.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1200}, {"role": "body", "text": "Shirley Hazzard, by Brigitta Olubas (Farrar, Straus & Giroux).

The seven stories that make up this haunting book, by an Argentinean novelist, feature characters confronting their own estrangement\u2014from their families, their neighborhoods, and themselves. In one story, the narrator and her mother rearrange parts of strangers\u2019 homes, an act that encapsulates the sense of alienation inspired by the houses of the book\u2019s title. In several tales, children die or disappear, leaving behind adults incapable of coping with loss. While Schweblin\u2019s shorter stories often rely too heavily on elision, the longest, about an elderly woman with dementia who observes her mind\u2019s deterioration, is deeply affecting."}]}
