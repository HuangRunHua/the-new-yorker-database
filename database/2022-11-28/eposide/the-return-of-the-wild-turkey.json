You meet them at caf\u00e9s and bus stops alike, the brindled hens clucking and cackling, calling their hatchlings, their jakes and their jennies, the big, blue-headed toms gurgling and gobble-gobbling. They look like Pilgrims, grave and gray-black, drab-daubed, their tail feathers edged in white, Puritan divines in ruffled cuffs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cThere was a great store of wild turkeys, of which they took many,\u201d the Mayflower arrival William Bradford wrote in his journal, during his first autumn in Plymouth, in 1621. Bradford didn\u2019t eat turkey at that first Thanksgiving, because, really, there was no first Thanksgiving that fall. Also, much of the food that he and his band of settlers ate they had taken, like their land, from the Wampanoag, and at the harvest celebration in question he may have eaten goose. But turkeys abounded. And no reader of the annals of early New England has ever forgotten Bradford\u2019s recounting of the public execution, in 1642, of a boy, aged sixteen or seventeen, hanged to death for having had sex with \u201ca mare, a cow, two goats, five sheep, two calves, and a turkey.\u201d (A turkey?) Benjamin Franklin, writing in 1784, thought the turkey \u201ca much more respectable Bird\u201d than the bald eagle, which was \u201ca Bird of bad moral Character,\u201d while the turkey was, if \u201ca little vain & silly, a Bird of Courage.\u201d Alas, by the end of the nineteenth century this particular fowl had nearly become extinct, hunted down, crowded out. The last known wild turkey in Massachusetts was killed in 1851, even as Americans killed passenger pigeons, by the hundreds of thousands, from flocks that numbered in the hundreds of millions. The last passenger pigeon, Martha, named for George Washington\u2019s wife, died in a zoo in Cincinnati, in 1914, and, not long afterward, heartbroken ornithologists tried to reintroduce the wild turkey into New England, without much success. Then, in the early nineteen-seventies, thirty-seven birds captured in the Adirondacks were released in the Berkshires, and their descendants are now everywhere, hundreds of thousands strong, brunching at Boston\u2019s Prudential Center, dining on Boston Common, and foraging alongside the Swan Boats that glide in the pond of Boston Public Garden. They most certainly do not make way for ducklings."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Birds, over all, are not faring well. Ornithologically, these are dystopian times, an avian apocalypse. One recent study estimates that the bird population of North America has fallen precipitously since 1970, down nearly three billion birds, one lost for every four. Not wild turkeys, whose numbers in New England are still rising. They eat everything: worms, hot dogs, sushi, your breakfast, grubs. They are fairly flightless and eerily fearless, three-foot-tall feathered dinosaurs."}, {"role": "body", "text": "If they look like Pilgrims, petty, pious, they also bear an uncanny resemblance to a mouthwatering main course, perambulating. Cows don\u2019t walk down Commonwealth Avenue, but if they did would they give you a hankering for a hamburger? If lambs grazed on the outfield at Fenway Park, would the sight of them leave you licking your lips at the thought of lamb chops, roasted with rosemary and lemon? Or would making their closer acquaintance convert you to vegetarianism? People don\u2019t meet their food anymore, even if they go to farmers\u2019 markets and farm-to-table bistros. But a turkey sashays past your office window and a cartoon thought bubble pops up above your head, of that turkey on a platter, trussed, stuffed, roasted, and glistening, the bare bones of its severed legs capped in ruffled white paper booties. Do you forswear fowl? A fat tom walks by, proud as a groom. \u201cIf only I had a musket,\u201d you hear someone say. \u201cI mean, or I could just grab it.\u201d Except, scofflaw, you can\u2019t."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In Massachusetts, you can hunt wild turkeys (since 1991, the state\u2019s official game bird), but only with a permit, only during turkey-hunting season, and only so long as you don\u2019t use bait, dogs, or electronic turkey callers. You are, to be fair, permitted to whistle. \u201cSit and call the birds to you,\u201d the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife advises. Yet beware: \u201cDo not wear red, white, blue, or black,\u201d or the gobblers, the full-grown males, might attack. Franklin offered the same caution: if a turkey ran into a British redcoat, woe to the soldier. This, my fellow-Americans, may be how we won the war."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cDon\u2019t feed the turkeys,\u201d one city office warns civilians, of the non-hunting sort. They may attack small children. (Small children\u2019s approach, however, may prove difficult to deter.) \u201cDon\u2019t let turkeys intimidate you.\u201d To daunt them, the henpecked advise, wield a broom or a garden hose, or get a dog. You sometimes see people standing their ground, a man chasing a squawking flock off his front porch, waving his arms. \u201cTired of the turkey shit on my steps,\u201d he snaps. A bicycle cop veers into a hen, on purpose, a near-miss, urging her away from a playground: \u201cScram, bird, scram!\u201d And still the turkeys gain ground: the people of New England appear indifferent to the advice of the Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, recalling childhood afternoons spent in schoolrooms, placing a hand on construction paper and tracing the outline of splayed and stubby fingers to draw a tom, its tail feathers spread wide. A turkey seemed, then, an imaginary, mythical animal\u2014a dragon, a unicorn. And here it is! Roosting in the dogwood tree outside your window, pecking at the subway grate, twisting its ruddy red neck and looking straight at you, like a long-lost dodo. What more might return in full force? Will you ever see a moose in Massachusetts? A great egret in Connecticut?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thanksgiving looms, a much trussed holiday. Meanwhile, night after night, sitting under heat lamps on the sidewalk in front of every neighborhood pizza place, diners toss oil-shimmered crusts to a rabble of turkeys, a muster of toms, a brood of hens, a mob of poults. \u201cA Pilgrim passed I to and fro,\u201d William Bradford once wrote. And there, a-gobbling, the new pilgrims go."}]}
