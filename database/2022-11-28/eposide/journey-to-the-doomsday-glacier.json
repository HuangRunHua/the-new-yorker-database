Its hull was painted a cheerful persimmon color, and its bow was conspicuously higher than the rest of the ship, with a curved shape suggesting that icebreakers don\u2019t so much carve through ice as climb and crush, climb and crush. It was January 3rd, summer in New Zealand. In the heat, ice was a little hard to picture, let alone icebreaking."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Our voyage would last two months.

Unger Vetlesen Foundation, an Earth-science nonprofit. For the second time, I would be working alongside Jamin Greenbaum, a forty-two-year-old scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, at the University of California, San Diego.

Thwaites, which is named for a late, eminent geologist, is on the southern side of the thumb, where it meets the hand. There are bigger glaciers elsewhere in Antarctica, and they are also showing signs of weakness, but Thwaites is especially concerning. Its adjoining ice shelf\u2014a large floating expanse of ice, which extends from the glacier out over the water\u2014acts like a cork in a wine bottle, holding much of the rest of the glacier in place. If the cork decays and gives way, the glacier could begin to flow rapidly, and eventually it and a larger stretch of surrounding ice in West Antarctica might slide or calve into the ocean. Thwaites is often known as the Doomsday Glacier, because, in this worst-case scenario, sea levels could rise by several feet or more, inundating many of the world\u2019s low-lying coastlines."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Thwaites is already retreating\u2014that is, it is shrinking, as more of its ice flows into the sea. Glaciologists and geophysicists want to figure out whether a colossal \u201cretreat event\u201d is likely to happen in fifty years, a hundred years, or five hundred years. To investigate the situation, our expedition would explore Thwaites by land, sea, and air. The Araon had seawater laboratories, underwater probes, and two helicopters; it also carried drones, snowmobiles, a disassembled hot-water drill, Zodiac watercraft, and a subsurface glider\u2014a kind of robotic dolphin\u2014that could take seawater measurements autonomously. Yet all of this would be useless if we couldn\u2019t get to Thwaites, which is one of the least accessible places on the planet. To reach the glacier by air, you must first travel overland to construct an improvised airport. Go by sea, and there\u2019s a good chance that your ship will get overwhelmed by ice and be forced to turn back.

As we gathered at the Christchurch docks with our luggage, I looked between them, past bobbing sailboats, to where behemoths the size of oil tankers loomed.

The sheet, which is broadly dome-shaped, grows as snow falls upon it; over time, the continuously falling snow compacts, and the sheet expands outward, held in place by rocks and mountain peaks. In most of the world, glaciers grow on mountains and flow down. In Antarctica, they are moving parts of the larger ice sheet. When the ice expands beyond the land, at a point called the grounding line, it starts floating on the sea, becoming an ice shelf. As the ice shelf grows, it meets geologic features, such as islands, and these allow it to push back against the ice sheet from which it came. The shelf and the sheet help to stabilize each other, like a flying buttress and a cathedral arch."}, {"role": "body", "text": "As far as we understand it, problems start when warm ocean water gets into vulnerable places like Thwaites. The water eats away at the ice by the grounding line. This ice starts to thin and flow outward faster, becoming more fragile. The buttressing effect weakens. The grounded ice sheet loses mass and starts to float, and, gradually, more water enters the bowl. This process, which could potentially become irreversible, is marine-ice-sheet instability."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/6376f274b19ab8521b9fe4cc/master/w_1600,c_limit/221128_a27059.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 1354, "imageDescription": "\u201cIn lieu of flowers, please send twenty anchovy pizzas to Glen Rayburn, at 179 Warren Street . . .\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Eayrs and Holland would be working as part of a team that hoped to use the ship\u2019s helicopters to establish an ice camp on Thwaites.

The British Antarctic Survey had led the effort to build the drill, and the Koreans had partnered with British researchers to learn how to assemble and operate it. Meanwhile, other scientists on board the Araon would study the Amundsen Sea\u2019s water and microbial life.

The cold became otherworldly. I had pictured icebergs as diamonds jutting from the sea, but the ones we encountered were flat slabs a hundred feet high.
