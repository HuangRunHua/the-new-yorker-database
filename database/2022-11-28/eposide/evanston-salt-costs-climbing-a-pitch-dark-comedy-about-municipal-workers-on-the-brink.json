The designer Matt Saunders has filled the proscenium, from the floor to the grid, with a huge wall\u2014an expanse of what looks like corrugated steel pierced by those twin roll-up garage doors, with a single human-size door standing between them. This is the industrial warehouse where the city of Evanston, Illinois, keeps its piles of road salt, but it\u2019s also where the audience stores its dread. The doors grind up and down, slow-opening mouths that reveal an interior as black as a throat. (Isabella Byrd lit the darkness; Mikaal Sulaiman did the chill-inducing sound design.) There\u2019s a thin strip of playing area in front of the wall, where the characters\u2014most of them employees of the Evanston municipal-works department\u2014can stand and chat, and some scenes happen on black platforms inside the warehouse. But, even when the gates are rolled down tight, you sense the pull of that cold, lightless abyss behind them, dragging at the characters\u2019 fragile human warmth like the vacuum of space."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cEvanston Salt Costs Climbing\u201d tells the tale of three frozen Januaries\u20142014, 2015, 2016\u2014and of the two guys who drive Evanston\u2019s salting truck, the mentally unstable Peter (Jeb Kreager) and the secretive Basil (Ken Leung). Their casting is canny: Kreager played a creepy cop on \u201cMare of Easttown\u201d; Leung starred on \u201cLost\u201d for years. \u201cEvanston\u201d exists somewhere between those two shows, toggling from \u201cEasttown\u201d \u2019s gritty, wintertime realism to \u201cLost\u201d \u2019s Manichaean, allegorical menace."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arbery is the playwright of the moment\u2014both our fascism-adjacent political one and the global-existential climate-crisis one. He was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2020 for \u201cHeroes of the Fourth Turning,\u201d his portrait of the right-wing faithful; this production, staged by the New Group and directed by Danya Taymor (she also directed \u201cHeroes\u201d), is the second major production of his to appear in New York this year. (\u201cCorsicana\u201d was at Playwrights Horizons over the summer, and its relative sweetness might linger for some audiences.) Taken together with his more experimental play \u201cPlano,\u201d these works display the components of the Arbery style. He employs a sense of the hidden, whether as a supernatural presence or as some coincidence that goes beyond the rational. He\u2019s rhythmically very free, switching between long stretches of text, realistic talk, and rapid, language-as-sound exchanges. And there\u2019s a single drumbeat driving his work: things are bad, the badness is out there, and, sorry to say, the badness is getting closer."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Taymor, as before, explores all Arbery\u2019s delicate shadings. Peter and Basil communicate in a shorthand built during their long nights on the roads, and the wonderful Leung and Kreager infuse a few pages of sophomoric back-and-forth (\u201cFuck you. No fuck you ha-ha\u201d) with complex dramatic layers. Their boss, \u201cassistant public works director in charge of city snow removal operations\u201d Jane Maiworm (Quincy Tyler Bernstine, honored by the Obies in 2019 for sustained excellence), likes to pop by in the predawn hours before the men head out on their rounds. She rallies their spirits and reads them articles from the local paper. Will the climbing salt costs lead to layoffs? Are the roads safe? Maiworm is the conscience of the play, ready to defend her incremental, effortful, impossible work, even when she\u2019s challenged on it. \u201cAdministration is service! Every day! That\u2019s what I do! \u201d she cries."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Maiworm has an adult stepdaughter, Jane Jr. (Rachel Sachnoff), who lives on a narrow ledge between debilitating anxiety and function, and she panics when her mother leaves her alone. \u201cThere\u2019s something under everything and it\u2019s making us all want to die,\u201d she says, in one of Sachnoff\u2019s most gripping scenes. Peter, too, senses this awful psychic pressure, and his joshing exchanges with Basil in their truck\u2019s cab\u2014they have a hilarious bit about the heat finally coming on and not wanting to \u201cover-celebrate,\u201d since it might offend the truck\u2014cannot keep his depression at bay."}, {"role": "quote", "text": "Peter: Thanks for trying to cheer me up but it takes a while to sink in.

Maiworm is having horrible dreams about paving options. Basil misses his home in Greece, which he left for an unnamed reason, one possibly illuminated by the eerie short stories he writes. But Peter is the one who hums with threat. One moment, he\u2019s talking about an innocent enthusiasm, like the Domino\u2019s pizza tracker; the next, his overloaded emotional system throws off sparks. Melancholy is slow-creep contagious, but Peter also conveys a sense of immediate, crackling danger. Kreager is tall, and he uses his height effectively\u2014he looms up suddenly next to Leung, like a tree that\u2019s jumped in front of a skidding car."}, {"role": "body", "text": "In a world of content warnings (one of which is included on the theatre\u2019s Web site) and careful phrasing, Arbery\u2019s bleakness and frank talk about the death urge are shocking. Characters connect because of shared hallucinations or coinciding suicidal thoughts. \u201cYou aren\u2019t actually gonna kill yourself silently one night outta nowhere,\u201d Peter says to Jane Jr., even though we have been worried about his capacity for self-harm for nearly the entire show. Perhaps one just likes \u201clooking at the shadow body of it,\u201d he suggests, elliptically, and the play prompts just this sort of Greek-tragedy-style catharsis\u2014of watching people say and think the worst, knowing that it isn\u2019t real."}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cEvanston\u201d premi\u00e8red in Massachusetts in 2018, but it somehow contains much of the desperation of the past three destabilizing years: there isn\u2019t a flicker of sunshine in it, even though Arbery is reliably funny and, in an upside-down way, galvanizing. He broaches a host of hyper-relevant issues: a climate that grows less clement every year, the biome-destroying potential of road salt (\u201cThat\u2019s what happens to bunnies in the winter. They eat salt and die confused,\u201d Maiworm says), American municipal underinvestment, untreated mental illness. Maiworm is a devotee of the urbanist Jane Jacobs. (This is the play\u2019s third Jane; Fates, Graces, and Furies also come in threes.) She gives Jacobs\u2019s book \u201cThe Death and Life of Great American Cities\u201d to the guys. Basil has memorized a quote, which he recites for Jane Jr.: \u201cThere is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder, and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Arbery\u2019s project as a playwright is to yank away that \u201cdishonest mask of pretended order,\u201d using the means he has at hand\u2014the empathetic tools of performance and the electrifying effects of wild unreality. Some very odd things happen in the deep nights and early mornings of \u201cEvanston Salt Costs Climbing\u201d: figures escape from nightmares, the dead climb up from underneath the asphalt, people take comfort, paradoxically, in despair."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The reason for this, I think, is that Arbery is writing about issues that tend to lead to indulgent hopelessness. Look at what we\u2019re doing to the earth, we think\u2014well, it\u2019s too far gone now to do anything. But what if looking right into the heart of catastrophe could actually get us to act? In \u201cEvanston,\u201d something pulsing and dark and Lovecraftian wants us dead\u2014got it. The weather is getting worse\u2014got it. But Maiworm is certainly still going. What\u2019s so scary about some garage doors in the face of her sturdy labor? You couldn\u2019t make this point so well without Bernstine in the role. As she has done in countless beautiful performances, she anchors the show with her wry, rasping voice and her refusal to sentimentalize. At one point, she struggles in a gale against the screaming wind. She hasn\u2019t got her parka; she\u2019s vulnerable. But I tell you\u2014I wouldn\u2019t bet on the wind."}]}
