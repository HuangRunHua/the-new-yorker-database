Twenty-three turbines dot the spine of the Appalachians, irregularly spaced along the mountain ridges. The towers, supplied by Siemens Gamesa, rise three hundred feet, looking like giant pinwheels amid a rolling landscape of small towns and windy roads. The rotating blades can be seen from Maryland and Pennsylvania. Down below is Mineral County and its county seat, Keyser, a former manufacturing and railroad hub that overlooks a branch of the Potomac."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Five full-time employees maintain the turbines. Each tower has an internal ladder. After climbing to the top, the workers can investigate errant temperature readings\u2014the gearbox can overheat\u2014or worrisome signals from the tower\u2019s sensors. Once a year, the team adjusts the calibrations of the blades, checks the tension on bolts, and tests the structural integrity of the equipment. Cleanliness is important to the successful functioning of such a delicate apparatus, and the employees take pride in their work. They often lug up a trash bag filled with rags, and use Simple Green cleaner to leave the towers gleaming in the sun. This is the first generation of West Virginians to trade work underground for work up high."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The state, once shackled to a coal economy, now has about four hundred turbines, which collectively can produce about seven hundred and fifty megawatts\u2014enough to power more than two hundred thousand homes. The crew in Keyser is managed by James Adkins, a forty-six-year-old who used to work in a big-box store. Though the turbines require only a small crew to keep them running, Adkins emphasized that Pinnacle\u2019s installation of the wind farm \u201ccreated hundreds of jobs\u2014local people and unionized jobs.\u201d Pinnacle\u2019s parent company has a program that takes laid-off coal-industry workers and retrains them for clean-energy jobs.
