On September 17th, Merbok, which had been downgraded to an extratropical storm, reached the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and the Bering Sea inlet of Norton Sound, one of the strongest storms to hit the area in fifty years.

Building housing is an expensive and laborious process in the remote Arctic, and no single federal agency is responsible for relocating communities facing environmental threats. After more than a decade of navigating government bureaucracies, tribal members successfully lobbied for the construction of a bridge from Kivalina to the mainland. Its completion, in 2021, created a vital evacuation route where once the only possibility of escape was by water or air. The bridge is part of an eight-mile road that zigzags across the tundra, which is covered in snow in winter and prone to flooding in spring and fall. It ends at the foot of a large hill, where a newly constructed school forms the heart of the future village. More years are likely to pass before homes are built there, even as engineers predicted, in 2013, that Kivalina will be fully under water by 2025. The new site is a desolate and rocky place, but, at an elevation of a hundred and twenty-five feet, it is a safe distance from Kivalina\u2019s receding beach and eroding riverbanks. Until the community can move inland, residents live with the worry that the right storm at the right moment could wipe out everything."}, {"role": "body", "text": "With Merbok, at least, the waters of the Kivalina Lagoon, which separates the island from the mainland, rose but did not flood their banks.

The seats on the other side were loaded up with cases of Pepsi and boxes of Puffs Ultra Soft tissue. Like dozens of similarly isolated villages, Kivalina is not accessible to the rest of Alaska by road or connected to a regional electric grid.

I walked past houses with snowmobiles parked haphazardly outside, and dogs chained to fenceposts. A family were putting away a harpoon, used to hunt beluga in the summer, and readying their boat for seining, the net fishing that happens in the fall. Another family rolled past on A.T.V.s.

It is common in Inupiat families for grandparents to adopt a grandchild to help them around the house as they age. When Mitchell was eight or nine, her grandmother chose her to come live with her and her husband, just as today Mitchell\u2019s grandson Aaron lives with Mitchell. Her youth was one of physical labor\u2014chopping wood, lugging ice, and hanging the slabs of ugruk, or bearded seal, that her grandmother butchered. Mitchell\u2019s family followed the subsistence food-gathering patterns of the seasons, and in the spring she would sometimes join her father\u2019s whaling crew at their encampment on the ice, to hunt bowhead whales.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, they had only minimal contact with Westerners. Then American whalers came to the region, decimating the bowhead and walrus populations and contributing to the spread of deadly epidemics. The Kivalli\u00f1igmiut nation was scattered by famine in the early eighteen-eighties, but for Mitchell\u2019s great-grandmother\u2019s generation the barrier island of Kivalina remained a summer base from which to hunt marine mammals: ugruk, walrus, and beluga whales.

Like many Alaska Native villages situated on shorelines and riverbanks around the state, Kivalina was presumably chosen because of its accessibility by water. The government, in mandating the attendance of the region\u2019s children, began a project of forced settlement in a place that was seen as precarious from the outset. Mitchell maintains a history of Kivalina on a Web site, which references the oldest known written request for relocation. A teacher named Clinton S. Replogle wrote an official report in 1911: Kivalina \u201cis very beautifully situated when the weather is nice and calm, but when the wind blows from the south it raises the water in the ocean until it sometimes almost comes over the banks. . . .

In 1963, the tribe voted on the issue, and a split vote resulted in the community\u2019s staying on the island. It was in the nineteen-seventies that the village\u2019s wooden houses replaced the sod ones. There were other changes, too. Snow machines (as snowmobiles are known in Alaska) replaced dogsled teams. Outboard motorboats and Hondas (regional shorthand for the four-wheel A.T.V.s that everyone in Kivalina uses to get around) replaced skin boats. Stove oil replaced driftwood for heat. An airstrip, completed in 1960, connected Kivalina by air to the rest of Alaska and beyond.

The corporation was formed after the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in 1971, which ceded some forty million acres of land in Alaska to Native-owned corporations (in exchange for their relinquishing claims over the rest) and offered Native Alaskans a stake in the sale of oil and mineral leases on their land. The act gave Native Alaskans greater self-determination, but it also linked their economic well-being to the commercial exploitation of their lands."}, {"role": "body", "text": "By the nineteen-nineties, as the population grew, discussions about relocation in Kivalina focussed more on overcrowded homes and a lack of water and sewer systems. But in the early two-thousands a series of weather events made the need to move a matter of urgent survival. It has become a well-known fact that the Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, making the weather increasingly unfamiliar. Some shifts were gradual, like the loss of sea ice: according to one study, the ice-free period in the Chukchi Sea increased from three months to five months between the nineteen-eighties and the early two-thousands. Others were sudden: Mitchell recalls the first time she saw lightning over the village, around 2010.

The previous day, I had met Swan in the offices of the Kivalina City Council, where she was doing volunteer work for the Fire Department and the search-and-rescue team.

The parkas are made from padded nylon fabric, with ribbon-and-bias-tape embellishments in patterns designed by Adams. Everyone in the class had finished her coat except a high-school student, who sat silently stitching fox fur onto her parka, a thimble on one finger. The large room was cozy and smelled faintly of Lysol. Adams wore a T-shirt with a husky sporting a mining hat from the Red Dog Mine, where she used to work. On the radio, which was playing through a CD-cassette boom box, an announcer read the temperatures and wind speeds of various villages over a gentle hiss of static."}, {"role": "body", "text": "After the student finished sewing, she and Adams brushed bits of thread from the coat using a coffee filter. \u201cDrumroll!\u201d Adams said, beaming, as the student tried it on.

In Inupiat tradition, a young hunter\u2019s first kill is given to elders and people in need, and the nephew had given the moose to Adams to help distribute it. She had passed on the best parts to his grandmother but kept the ribs, to make into a soup."}, {"role": "image", "imageURL": "https://media.newyorker.com/cartoons/63766ea3115c8e5ce44ecff7/master/w_1600,c_limit/221128_a26536.jpg", "imageWidth": 1600, "imageHeight": 901, "imageDescription": "\u201cWe used to hibernate, but then we got the matching scarves.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Kivalina has few social spaces.

Every Native corporation in Alaska gets a cut of the revenue, but Kivalina bears a disproportionate environmental impact.

In 2017, the village, nana, and Teck signed a memorandum of agreement to jointly address environmental concerns.

There was a small, bright-colored playground in front of the school, and two yellow school buses, brought from Anchorage by barge, were parked nearby.

The buses looked as though they\u2019d been designed for another universe, one of paved roads, gas stations, and crossing guards. Next to the school was a construction camp housing some of the workers I\u2019d seen on my flight from Anchorage. They mostly kept to themselves, their food brought in from elsewhere.

Mitchell and Swan exchanged stories of the Little People, a parallel tribe who, Mitchell told me, lived among the Inupiat people before deciding that they preferred to live in isolation. Some say that Little People still visit Kivalina. On his phone, Swan showed me a zoomed-in photograph that featured several white dots outside a cave. In the next photo, the dots had disappeared, and Swan suggested that they might have been Little People. Swan and Dolly spotted a couple of musk oxen in the distance, but nothing they cared to pursue.
