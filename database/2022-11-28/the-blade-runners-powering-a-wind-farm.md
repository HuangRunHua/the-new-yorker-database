The Pinnacle wind-power plant extends for roughly four miles in the northeastern corner of West Virginia. Twenty-three turbines dot the spine of the Appalachians, irregularly spaced along the mountain ridges. The towers, supplied by Siemens Gamesa, rise three hundred feet, looking like giant pinwheels amid a rolling landscape of small towns and windy roads. The rotating blades can be seen from Maryland and Pennsylvania. Down below is Mineral County and its county seat, Keyser, a former manufacturing and railroad hub that overlooks a branch of the Potomac.

Five full-time employees maintain the turbines. Each tower has an internal ladder. After climbing to the top, the workers can investigate errant temperature readings—the gearbox can overheat—or worrisome signals from the tower’s sensors. Once a year, the team adjusts the calibrations of the blades, checks the tension on bolts, and tests the structural integrity of the equipment. Cleanliness is important to the successful functioning of such a delicate apparatus, and the employees take pride in their work. They often lug up a trash bag filled with rags, and use Simple Green cleaner to leave the towers gleaming in the sun. This is the first generation of West Virginians to trade work underground for work up high.

The state, once shackled to a coal economy, now has about four hundred turbines, which collectively can produce about seven hundred and fifty megawatts—enough to power more than two hundred thousand homes. The crew in Keyser is managed by James Adkins, a forty-six-year-old who used to work in a big-box store. Though the turbines require only a small crew to keep them running, Adkins emphasized that Pinnacle’s installation of the wind farm “created hundreds of jobs—local people and unionized jobs.” Pinnacle’s parent company has a program that takes laid-off coal-industry workers and retrains them for clean-energy jobs. The company also stops by schools, giving children a chance to try on hard hats and to learn about the advantages of wind energy. Extracting coal is dirty work—in 1993, the Baltimore Sun quoted conservation officials as saying that runoff from mines had made the Potomac branch as toxic as battery acid.

All the same, Adkins and his four colleagues have had trouble convincing their neighbors of the value of wind farms. The newest member of the crew, Andrew Cosner, is twenty-one, and the grandson of a coal miner. “People are, like, ‘I don’t understand why this is such a big thing,’ ” he said. “They say it ruins the landscape and it’s ugly.” Brandon Kisamore, a thirty-nine-year-old who joined the Pinnacle team after his job at a coal-fired plant was eliminated, has decorated his desk with a “Friends of Coal” decal, to remind visitors that locals are in this together. But he sometimes faces hostility when he goes into town wearing a Pinnacle uniform. “They think the power’s going somewhere else,” he said. “It goes into the power grid, but they don’t understand.” One time, Adkins was waylaid by an older woman in Keyser, who insisted that the turbines were blowing snow from the mountains onto the town’s streets. “I tried to explain, ‘That’s not how they work,’ ” he said. “She wasn’t angry, but she was confused.”

This collection of photographs, by Philip Montgomery, calls to mind Lewis Hine’s famous images of laborers constructing the Empire State Building, and also the iconic 1932 shot of ironworkers casually dangling their feet off an I-beam, far above Rockefeller Center. At the Pinnacle facility, however, many of the workers deal with an initial fear of heights. Kisamore says that it took him three months before he could go up a tower without feeling sick, and Adkins urges students at the local community college who hope to work at Pinnacle to do a test climb of a tower. “You could waste two years of your life and find out you just can’t handle the job,” he said.

For workers who can conquer their fear, though, it’s beautiful up there. Cosner said, “I’m never afraid of looking out, because you don’t realize how high up you are.” The team’s day often starts at around 6 a.m. “It’s real nice then,” Kisamore said. “You can see the sun come up.”
