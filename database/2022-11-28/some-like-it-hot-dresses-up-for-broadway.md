The man-in-a-dress comedy is one of Hollywood’s hoariest genres and, in recent years, fodder for Broadway musicals (“Tootsie,” “Mrs. Doubtfire”). But it all traces back to “Some Like It Hot,” Billy Wilder’s classic film from 1959. A new musical version, in previews at the Shubert, with direction by Casey Nicholaw and songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (“Hairspray”), aims to splice the old-school fun with contemporary gender politics. Adrianna Hicks, J. Harrison Ghee, and Christian Borle (above, left to right) lead the cast.
