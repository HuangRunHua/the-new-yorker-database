It\u2019s a series of micro-essays, ranging in length from a sentence to a paragraph, on seemingly disconnected subjects\u2014orchids, rain, the mythic Andean vicu\u00f1a. Her \u201cShort Talk on the Sensation of Airplane Takeoff\u201d is what it sounds like. Her \u201cShort Talk on Trout\u201d is mostly about the types of trout that appear in haiku. In what passes for the book\u2019s introduction, Carson writes, with dry Canadian relatability, \u201cI will do anything to avoid boredom. It is the task of a lifetime.\u201d Right about when she published that, the internet started to take off."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Fast-forward 30 years and one of the latest ways to avoid boredom, at least for me, is to stay up late and goof around with AI image generation. Tools such as DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion can be instructed, with textual prompts, to produce ersatz oil paintings of dogs in hats in the style of Titian, or simulated photos of plasticine models of astronauts riding horses. When I first started playing with Stable Diffusion\u2014which is open source and very fun\u2014I was reminded of Carson\u2019s talks. I went back to them to figure out why. Pretty quickly I realized that the resemblance had something to do with form."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Everyone says content is king, but the secret monarch of the content economy is form\u2014constraints, rules, minima and maxima. You grow up learning form. A high school essay is five paragraphs. Sitcoms leave eight minutes in the half hour for ads. Novels are long. Tweets are capped at 280 characters."}, {"role": "body", "text": "What differentiates my tweet or essay or studio film from yours? The choices each of us makes within the form. In a word, our style. Carson\u2019s book takes a familiar form, the little lecture, and subverts it, manipulates it, until as the reader you start to feel like you\u2019re inside her wonderful brain, scrolling through her mental browser history, joining her in hyperlinked fancies and half-abandoned rabbit holes. Image generation is kind of like that\u2014but instead of communing with a single brilliant Canadian brain, you\u2019re communing with a giant idiot world-brain. (A less neurological way to put it: vast numbers of data objects grouped in layers, connected together to an incomprehensible degree, like string-and-nail wall art of a many-masted clipper ship but on fire with the flow of data.)"}, {"role": "quote", "text": "The people who can use the new tools will have new power.

But the AI generators bug a lot of people. These tools work by spidering images from across the internet, absorbing the visual culture contained within them by scanning their captions, then adding fizzy visual noise to them until they look like static. To make a new image, the AI starts with a caption and some static, then runs the process backward, removing noise until an image appears that lines up with the caption, more or less. (It\u2019s bad at drawing hands, but so am I.)"}, {"role": "body", "text": "This feels gross. It feels gross to see artists databased into oblivion. It feels gross that someone could say to a computer, \u201cI want a portrait of Alex Jones in the style of Frida Kahlo,\u201d and the computer would do it without moral judgment. These systems roll scenes, territories, cultures\u2014things people thought of as \u201ctheirs,\u201d \u201ctheir living,\u201d and \u201ctheir craft\u201d\u2014into a 4-gigabyte, open source tarball that you can download onto a Mac in order to make a baseball-playing penguin in the style of Hayao Miyazaki. The people who can use the new tools will have new power. The people who were great at the old tools (paintbrushes, cameras, Adobe Illustrator) will be thanked for their service and rendered into Soylent. It\u2019s as if a guy wearing Allbirds has stumbled into a residential neighborhood where everyone is just barely holding on and says, \u201cI love this place, it\u2019s so quirky! Siri, play my Quirky playlist. And open a Blue Bottle on the corner!\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "SO NATURALLY, PEOPLE are upset. Art websites are banning AI-generated work, at least for now; stock image services are refusing it too. Prominent bloggers who experimented with having an AI illustrate their writing have been chastened on Twitter and have promised not to do it again. AI companies are talking a lot about ethics, which always makes me suspicious, and certain words are banned from the image generator\u2019s interface, which is sad because I wanted to ask the bot to paint a \u201cbusty\u201d cottage in the style of Thomas Kinkade.

In a decade, or 10 minutes (time is blurry around this stuff), we\u2019ll be saying things like, \u201cComputer, make a version of Die Hard where all the characters are corgis.\u201d Then we\u2019ll post it to YouTube, which will use machine learning to make sure the film studio gets its pre-negotiated cut for the audio track. Then other systems will download the video and decide that there is a connection between the voice of arch-terrorist Hans Gruber (portrayed by Alan Rickman) and corgis, which will result in a rogue AI-enhanced compression algorithm replacing all instances of Snape in Harry Potter with a corgi, leading to the Great Corgi Cinematic Snowball Virus of 2024, after which all filmed entertainment will feature only corgis and the occasional crossbreed like corgipoos and borgles. This will ruin Game of Thrones but will make The Purge adorable."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Remember: In the days of powdered wigs, musicians who liked the pluckiness of the harpsichord complained that the piano sounded soft and dull. Much later musicians (and their unions) fought the synthesizer, fearing it would bleep-bloop careers into oblivion. New systems always seem, at first, to devalue craft, shift power, and wreck cultures and scenes. This is because they do all of that. And we, downstream in time, invariably fall prey to the historical fallacy and go, Oh, those worrywarts! How stubbornly they clung to their harpsichords. We know that, without the piano, there\u2019d be no Shostakovich or Satie or Margaret Leng Tan; without synths, no Wendy Carlos, Kraftwerk, or Pet Shop Boys."}, {"role": "body", "text": "I asked GPT-3, an AI text generator, to write me \u201ca Short Talk on trout in the style of Anne Carson.\u201d It replied: \u201cTrout are most active in the early morning and late evening, so those are the best times to go fishing.\u201d I went back to the original. Of the trout found in haiku, Carson writes: \u201cWorn out, completely exhausted, they are going down to the sea.\u201d I think we can agree that the Canadian brain wins this one. But we do not have to choose between, on the one hand, an unthinking digital pseudobrain and, on the other, the artifacts of a single human mind. The miracle of the age is that we can learn from both, whenever we like. Anything to avoid boredom."}]}
