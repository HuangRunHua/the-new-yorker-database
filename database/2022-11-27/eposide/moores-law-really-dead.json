Moore\u2019s law states\u2014"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Well, that one doesn\u2019t state. It wagers. It hazards a guess. It contains no constants, no special functions, no variables, no equations at all. Movie directors will find in Moore\u2019s law nothing like the kind of pretty runes that John Nash or Ben Affleck might scrawl on a window with a wax pencil. In fact, Moore\u2019s law is less a law than a flier, a bit of Johnson-era bookmaking. Every year (or two) for a decade\u2014or so the \u201claw\u201d goes\u2014engineers would maybe, probably, double the number of transistors they could stuff onto a silicon chip."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Such was the bet of Gordon Moore, then the research director at the illustrious Fairchild Semiconductor, an outfit based in Sunnyvale, California, that in those days was known mostly as a division of the Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation. Electronics, a throwaway circular for the radio industry, picked up one of Moore\u2019s reports for Fairchild and published it as \u201cCramming More Components Onto Integrated Circuits\u201d on April 19, 1965."}, {"role": "body", "text": "It was a hit. Prescient is too weak a word: \u201cIntegrated circuits will lead to such wonders as home computers, or at least terminals connected to a central computer, automatic controls for automobiles, and personal portable communications equipment.\u201d Such wonders. The essay dates to a time when a computer costs $18,000 (around $170,000 today). To make one affordable for a household, let alone an individual, will take a miracle. Moore, who later cofounded Intel, gives the miracle a shove with his resounding vote of confidence in tech workers for whom \u201cYou can do it\u201d turns into \u201cYou must do it\u201d turns into \u201cYou will do it\u201d turns into \u201cIt\u2019s natural law.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "\u201cCramming\u201d in this way sweeps you up in a tide of inevitability. It\u2019s only slightly too grand to say the essay recalls the Declaration of Independence. (\u201cWhen in the course of human events\u201d also makes revolution sound like natural law.) For a piece about integrated circuits, moreover, \u201cCramming\u201d partakes of the marvelous-fantastic genre; nothing Moore predicts for the future\u2014and that future is now\u2014is anything less than riotously fun."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Five years after the essay\u2019s publication, Carver Mead, a renowned scientist who just this year won a tidy 100 million yen as the Kyoto Prize laureate, playfully dubbed its projections a law. Thus the standing orders to America\u2019s postwar engineers became clear: Miniaturize transistors and reduce costs. A world of workers have applied themselves to this task ever since. As much as Moore\u2019s skills as a would-be legislator, his infectious enthusiasm for semiconductors has inspired these decades of engineering commitment. \u201cCramming\u201d is still well worth reading, especially if all you know of Moore\u2019s law is the doubling thing. Not only is it vatic, robust, and refined at once, it\u2019s a piece of prose without precedent, a speech act that brought into being a whole global economic sector."}, {"role": "body", "text": "THE ESSAY\u2019S STRENGTH lies in its bold, bullish copulative sentences that use \u201cis\u201d like an equal sign and land with absolute certainty. \u201cThe future of integrated electronics is the future of electronics itself.\u201d Blammo. Some of the prose then sounds like a patriotic newsreel (\u201cNo American can have freedom and justice unless there is freedom and justice for all!!\u201d) or like Johnson himself bucking up geopolitical spirits. In the very month that \u201cCramming\u201d appeared, LBJ declared of Vietnam, \u201cThe only path of reasonable men is the path of peaceful settlement.\u201d"}, {"role": "body", "text": "Then there is the essay\u2019s central claim: \u201cWith unit cost falling as the number of components per circuit rises, by 1975 economics may dictate squeezing as many as 65,000 components on a single silicon chip.\u201d In spite of the hedge (\u201cmay dictate\u201d), the negative slope\u2014in which the two variables, unit cost and number of components, are inversely related\u2014has a rousing momentum to it."}, {"role": "body", "text": "Elsewhere in the essay, Moore projects the exaggerated certitude of a pitch deck\u2014or maybe a graduate student who\u2019s trying to assure her doctoral supervisor that her research is coming along great. \u201cSeveral approaches evolved,\u201d Moore wrote, \u201cincluding microassembly techniques for individual components, thin film structures and semiconductor integrated circuits. Each approach evolved rapidly and converged \u2026 Many researchers believe the way of the future to be a combination of the various approaches.\u201d The profound appreciation of intellectual collaboration and convergence, which still rings through the semiconductor sector today, cannot have helped but leaven the mood of American scientists in the pre-moonwalk days, when the Soviets appeared to be winning the Space Race."}, {"role": "body", "text": "At 1,875 words, \u201cCramming\u201d is concise, as befits a polemic on compression. And then there\u2019s that word cramming, from the Old English crammian, \u201cto press something into something else.\u201d So palpable, greedy, and carnal. It\u2019s not when we\u2019re in the mood for measurement but when we\u2019re feeling recklessly indifferent to proportion and harmony that we cram things into our suitcases, our shoes, and our mouths. While the essay is in the slide-rule idiom of engineers, it also speaks to the gut. It\u2019s a goad to biennial home-optimizing that recommends balling up more of your shit, stuffing it into an overfull closet. This is a useful reminder that even at the scale of microns\u2014and now nanos\u2014scientists are still beholden to the constraints of physical space, at least until the path of all reasonable men becomes the path of quantum."}, {"role": "body", "text": "And quantum is the point. As a field of inquiry, quantum\u2014or AI, or the metaverse\u2014might not be so driven by the rhythm of Moore\u2019s law.

Lionel Trilling, sure, wrote \u201cAuthenticity and the Modern Unconscious\u201d around the time of \u201cCramming,\u201d and Wendell Berry\u2019s \u201cThe Long-Legged House\u201d is lovely. But did Trilling or Berry set the speedcore tempo for the global industry that animates the entire built universe?"}, {"role": "body", "text": "In 2005, realizing they lacked an original copy of \u201cCramming,\u201d Intel executives offered $10,000 on eBay for a mint copy of the relevant issue of Electronics. At last, an engineer in Surrey, UK, found one under his floorboards. The enchanted pages now sit in climate-controlled splendor in Intel\u2019s museum\u2014the tech world\u2019s Book of Kells."}, {"role": "body", "text": "The last phase of Moore\u2019s essay is a delight. Having delivered his whopping projection of 65,000 elements per chip\u2014it\u2019s now 11.8 billion\u2014Moore finally drops a statement of the purest trust in technology: \u201cI believe that such a large circuit can be built on a single wafer.\u201d Who would want to contradict Moore\u2019s idealism? Such expansive affirmations of belief, with a reference to a Communion-like wafer. No wonder \u201cCramming\u201d anchors the liturgy of the semiconductor business. In science, laws obtain. In tech, it\u2019s mostly faith."}]}
